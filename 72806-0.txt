That Dr. Stukeley had altered the plan of his intended History of
the antient Celts, &c. mentioned in the Preface of the former part
of this work, plainly appears by his publishing _Stonehenge_ and
_Abury_ separately: but, as many of the Plates he left unpublished
were undoubtedly intended for that Work, and others for a Second
Volume of the _Itinerarium_, neither of which were ever completed;
the Editor hopes it will give pleasure to the Learned to see those
Plates, together with such of his Tracts as relate to them, collected
into one Volume, and that they will be found not altogether unworthy
of their attention;—sensible however that the many defects which must
unavoidably happen in publishing a Posthumous Collection from loose
papers, and notes carelessly thrown together, will stand in need of
their candid indulgence.

The Itinerary of Richard of Cirencester, together with Dr. Stukeley’s
Account of, and Observations upon it, were thought by some Friends of
the Doctor a very proper addition. It is a tract truly valuable for the
new light it has thrown on the study of British Antiquities, and being
out of print is now become very scarce.

It may be expected that some account should in this place be given of
the Author, and his Works. A Catalogue of those which have appeared in
print we subjoin; and for his Life we refer the reader to Mr. Masters’s
History of Benet College, Cambridge, printed in quarto, 1753; adding
only, that he died March 3d, 1765, in his 78th year, and was buried in
the church-yard of East-Ham in Essex, having ordered by his will that
no memorial of him should be erected there.

  CAESAR’S Camp called the Brill at PANCRAS.

  _Stukeley desig. dec 1758_]




               _The_ BRILL, +Cæsar’s Camp+ _at_ Pancras.

                             October 1758.


Many and large volumes have been written on the celebrated city of
London, which now, beyond doubt, for magnitude, splendor, riches, and
traffic, exceeds every city upon the globe: the famous Pekin of China
only boasts itself to be larger. London, then called _Trinobantum_, was
a considerable trading _emporium_ in British times, and before Cæsar’s
arrival here. But the greatest curiosity of London, and what renders it
highly illustrious, has never been observed by any writer: to give some
account of it, is the purpose of this paper.

When I resided in London in the former part of my life, I proposed
to myself, as a subject of inquiry, for my excursions now and then
on horseback round the circuit of the metropolis, to trace out the
journeyings of Cæsar in his British expeditions. This I account the
_æra_ from whence we derive the certain intelligence of the state and
affairs of our native country. I was pretty successful therein, and
made many drawings of his camps, and mansions; several of which I then
engraved with a design of printing the copious memoirs I had wrote
concerning them.

No subject concerning our own country antiquities could be more noble.
But what I mean to speak of at this time, is a camp of his, which I
have long since observed no farther off than Pancras church.

In all my former travels, I ever proposed an entertainment of the mind,
in inquiries into matters of antiquity, a former state of things in my
own country: and now it is easy to imagine the pleasure to be found
in an agreeable walk from my situation in Queen’s Square, through the
fields that lead me to the footsteps of Cæsar, when, without going to
foreign parts, I can tread the ground which he trod. By finding out
several of his camps, I was enabled, off-hand, to distinguish them; and
they are very different from all others we meet withal.

It was the method of Roman discipline, to make a camp every night,
though they marched the next morning; but in an expedition like
Cæsar’s, in a new and unknown country, he was to trust to his own head,
and the arms of his troops, more than to banks and ditches: yet, for
the sake of discipline, a camp must be made every night; it was their
mansion, and as an home; where was the _prætorium_, or general’s tent,
and the Prætorian cohorts, as his guards; it was the residence of the
majesty of the Roman genius, in the person of the commander; it was as
a fixed point, subservient to order and regular discipline military;
where and whence every portion and subdivision of an army knew their
regular appointment and action.

This camp was very small; designed but for a night’s abode, unless the
exigence of affairs required some stay: but the third part of the army
lying under arms every night, prevented the danger of a surprise.

Cæsar, led on by divine Providence, entered our country in the year
before the vulgar æra of Christ 54. the second time, about the middle
of the month of July, as we now reckon, in his own Julian kalendar.
I shall not recapitulate what I have observed of the footsteps of
this great man in Kent; I hesitate not in believing that Carvilius,
one of the four kings, as called, who attacked his camp while he was
on this side the Thames, lived at Guildford; the name of the place
shows it; the river was called _Villy_, or Willy, a common British
name for rivers; so that Carvilius was a local title of honour, as was
the British custom, like that of our present nobility: so Casvelhan,
Cæsar’s opponent, was king of the _Cassii_, Cogidubnus of the _Dobuni_,
Togodumnus of the _Dumnonii_, _Taeog_ being _Dux_ in British. It was
the method of the British princes thus to take the names of towns, and
of people, as it was the method of their ancestors the Midianites; of
which we find an instance in Josephus, Antiq. +IV.+ 7. Rekam, a king
there, of the same name as his city, the capital of all Arabia; now
Petra.

Cæsar passed the Thames at Coway stakes, notwithstanding the stakes:
the town of Chertsey preserves a memorial of his name, as Cherburg in
France: he pursued the Britons along the bank of the Thames as far as
Sheperton, where the stakes were placed, and there pitched his camp
with the back of it upon the Thames. At his camp on Greenfield common,
near Staines, a splendid embassy came to him from the Londoners;
desiring his alliance and protection, and that he would restore their
prince Mandubrace, who was then in his retinue. To his little camp, or
_prætorium_, on this account he orders another to be drawn round it,
for reception of these ambassadors, and their prince, together with
forty hostages which he demanded, and corn for his army.

Upon this, ambassadors came to him from the _Cenimani_, people
of Cambridgeshire; the _Segontiaci_, Hampshire; _Ancalites_,
Buckinghamshire; _Bibroci_, about Berkshire; and _Cassii_, of
Hertfordshire; submitting themselves to him. For them he orders another
appendix to his camp, to receive them.

When business was done with them, he moves forward to attack Casvelhan,
who was retreated into his fortified town at Watford. One of his camps
thitherward, is to be seen very fair on Hounslow heath, in the way to
Longford; which I showed to lord Hertford then president, and to lord
Winchelsea vice-president, of the Antiquarian Society, in April, 1723;
who measured it, and expressed the greatest pleasure at the sight.

His next camp was at Kingsbury: it is now the church-yard, and still
visible enough: its situation is high, and near the river Brent: the
church stands in the middle of it.

From hence he went, and forced Casvelhan’s military _oppidum_ at
Watford, and Rickmansworth; a gravelly island of high ground, _sylvis
paludibusque munitum_, as he expresses it; and by this he brought
Casvelhan to submit. It is not my present purpose to speak largely
on these particulars; but from hence he advanced towards
London, effectually to settle his friend and ally Mandubrace, whose
protection he had undertaken, in the kingdom of the _Trinobantes_; and
reconcile him to his subjects, and to his uncle Casvelhan. Mandubrace
was the son of Immanuence, commonly called Lud in the British story,
which signifies the _brown_; who was killed by his ambitious brother
Casvelhan, too near a neighbour to London; his residence being at
Harrow on the hill, and Edgeware called _Suellaniacis_ from him: he
likewise forced Mandubrace to fly to Cæsar in Gaul, to implore his
aid: the great Roman was not averse to so favourable an opportunity of
advancing his glory, by invading Britain, a new world.

It was not suitable to his honour, or his security, to quarter in the
city of London; but he pitched his camp, where now is Pancras church:
his _prætorium_ is still very plain, overagainst the church, in the
foot-path, on the west side of the brook; the _vallum_ and the ditch
visible: its breadth from east to west forty paces; its length from
north to south sixty paces.

This was his _prætorium_, where his own tent was pitched in the centre;
the prætorian cohorts around it. There was no great magnificence in
Cæsar’s tent, here placed; it was not his manner. L. Aurunculeius
Cotta, who was here present, in his commentaries writes, when Cæsar
was in Britain, although he had acquired the highest fame by his
great actions, yet was he so temperate in his manner of life, such a
stranger to pomp, that he had only three servants in his tent. Cotta
was killed the next year in Gaul. When I came attentively to consider
the situation of it, and the circumjacent ground, I easily discerned
the traces of his whole camp: a great many ditches, or divisions of
the pastures, retain footsteps of the plan of the camp; agreeable to
their usual form, as in the plate engraved: and whenever I take a walk
thither, I enjoy a visionary scene of the whole camp of Cæsar, as
described in the Plate before us; a scene as just as if beheld, and
Cæsar present.

His army consisted of about 40,000 men, four legions with their horse.
After long debate of authors concerning the quantity of a Roman legion,
I infer, from Josephus so very often using the expression of ten
thousand, many ten thousands, and the like, that the usual and general
number of soldiers in a legion was ten thousand.

Authors generally state a legion at 6666 men; but they must mean
strictly the soldiery, without officers or horse: so that I conclude a
complete legion of foot and horse to be 10,000. Polibius, Vol. 2. book
iii. writes, in the war of Hannibal, each legion consisted of 5000,
besides the auxiliaries, together with 900 horse; and therefore we may
well judge, a legion with its officers should be reckoned 10,000.

  Romans            5000
  Auxiliaries       4000
  Horse              900
  Officers           100
                  ——————
                  10,000

Strabo writes, the Romans generally had their horses from Gaul.

Cæsar had now no apparent enemy; he had leisure to repose his men,
after their military toil. He was in the territory of a friend and ally
of the Roman state, whom he had highly obliged in restoring him to his
paternal kingdom: nor was it his purpose to abide here for any time:
he therefore did not fortify his whole camp with a broad ditch and
_vallum_ for security; but the army was disposed in its ordinary form
and manner: it might be bounded by a slight ditch and bank, as that of
the whole length of the camp on the west side, (the foot-path from the
bowling-green accompanying; or it might be staked out with pallisado’s
called _valli_) which returns again on part of the north side, at the
_porta decumana_, till it meets the ditch that passes on the west of
Cæsar’s _prætorium_, and so continued downward, to the houses at the
Brill.

This last-mentioned ditch runs on the line that separated the column
of the horse from the _Triarii_, on the west side of the camp; the
foot-way from the Brill accompanying it all the way. The _porta
decumana_ is left open in the back of the camp. The same of the _porta
prætoria_; but the bounds of the camp here at the south-west corner are
visible in two parallel banks remaining; the upper surface of the earth
between them, has been dug away for making bricks.

The oddness of the present division of the north-west pasture, inclosed
by that of the _postica castrorum_, preserves evident tokens of the
camp: the elbow to the west, concurring with a ditch on the eastern
border of the whole camp, preserves the track of the _via sagularis_;
here the baggage and carriages were placed: it extended itself behind
the _prætorium_. Pancras church stands upon this way.

The north-west field before specified is bounded by a ditch, which
marks out the street, that runs along the front of the _prætorium_;
along which were set the tents of the officers, the _præfecti_ of the
horse, and tribunes of the foot; along with the ensigns and standards
of the horse and foot, which were pitched in a line in the ground.

On the west side of the _prætorium_, in this pasture, was the open
place, a square _area_, comprehended between the _via principalis_,
or _principia_, and the _via sagularis_, called the _questorium_:
this was the quarters of the quæstor, M. Crassus; a promising young
man, who afterwards fell with his father, the triumvir, in Parthia.
Pompey married his widow. Hither the soldiers repaired to receive
their allowance of pay and provision: on the west side of it was the
quæstor’s tent, the military chest, the stores: just beyond, northward
was the station of Comius of Arras, auxiliary to Cæsar, with the
Gaulish troops under his command; likewise the tents of the Gaulish
princes, which Cæsar brought over with him to prevent their revolting
in his absence; among whom was the son of Indutiomarus prince of the
_Treviri_.

Come we to the _via prætoria_, or principal street of the camp,
extending along the middle line from the _prætorium_ to the houses at
the Brill; where is the _porta prætoria_ at the _frons castrorum_. The
gate between the two houses at the Brill, leading into the pasture
there, which pasture was the station of the horse, is in the very line
of the _via prætoria_. The front of the camp is bounded by a spring
with a little current of water, running from the west, across the
Brill, into the Fleet brook: the lane out of the great road, along this
spring, terminates in the _frons castrorum_, as an avenue to it; and
may be ancienter than the road along the valley, where the river runs,
to Pancras. This Brill was the occasion of the road directly from the
city originally going along the side of the brook by Bagnigge; the way
to Highgate being at first by Copenhagen house, which is the strait
road thither from Gray’s-inn lane, and before that of the valley to
Pancras, called Longwich in Norden’s _Speculum_.

It is not a little remarkable, that the name of _Brill_ should
through so many ages preserve the sure memorial of this most
respectable monument of Julius Cæsar’s camp. Camden, the Pausanias of
Britain, a genius great in his way as Julius Cæsar, takes notice, in
Buckinghamshire, “of the ancient Roman burgh, where much Roman money
is found, called the _Brill_; which was afterward a royal village of
Edward the Confessor’s; and, instead of Bury-hill, is by contraction
called _Brill_.”

In the additions to Camden’s _Britannia_, Sussex, thus we read: “Hard
by Chichester, toward the west, there has been a large Roman camp,
called the _Brile_, of an oblong form, four furlongs and two perches
in length, two furlongs in breadth: it lies in a flat low ground, with
a great rampire and single graff; probably Vespasian’s camp, after his
landing.” And the like must be said of the Brill in the Netherlands,
probably too one of Cæsar’s camps.

This camp at Pancras has the brook running quite through the middle
of it: it arises from seven springs on the south side of the hill
between Hampstead and Highgate, by Caen wood: there it forms several
large ponds, passes by here, by the name of Fleet, washes the west
side of the city of London, and gives name to Fleet-street. This brook
was formerly called the River of Wells, from the many springs above,
which our ancestors called Wells: and it may be thought to have been
more considerable in former times, than at present; for now the major
part of its water is carried off in pipes, to furnish Kentish-town,
Pancras, and Tottenham court: but even now, in great rains, the valley
is covered over with water. Go a quarter of a mile higher toward
Kentish-town, and you may have a just notion of its appearance at that
time, only with this difference, that it is there broader and deeper
from the current of so many years. It must further be considered,
that the channel of this brook, through so many centuries, and by its
being made the public north road from London to Highgate, is very
much lowered and widened since Cæsar’s time. It was then no sort of
embarrassment to the camp, but an admirable convenience for watering,
being contained in narrow banks, not deep: the breadth and depth is
made by long tract of time. The ancient road by Copenhagen, wanting
repair, induced passengers to take this gravelly valley, become much
larger than in Cæsar’s time. The old division runs along that road
between Finsbury and Holborn division, going in a strait line from
Gray’s-inn lane to Highgate: its antiquity is shown it its name,
Madan-lane.

Let us pass the brook, and consider the eastern half of the camp; only
remarking, that a ditch at present dividing the two pastures, which
was the station of the horse, is continued across the brook and road,
to that eastern half of the camp, and marks, when properly continued,
the two gates on the west and east side of the camp, called _porta
quæstoria_ and _porta principalis sinistra_: below it is the other
cross road of the camp, called _via Quintana_.

To the east of the _prætorium_ was a square plot, analogous to the
_questorium_: this was called the _forum_; this at present includes
the church-yard to its eastern fence, with the houses, the grove and
kitchen garden precisely. To the east of the _forum_ was the quarter
of the legates. Sulpitius Rufus, whose coin I have given above, we
may justly suppose one of them: he is mentioned by Cæsar as his
legate in the civil war; all the time with him in Gaul: and we can
have no scruple in thinking he was with him in Britain too. The coin
is in Goltzius’s _Julius Cæsar_, but reversed, Tab. ix. 1. he gives
no explication of it: it is in gold, but imperfect, here supplied.
Publius Sulpitius Rufus, mint-master to Cæsar, here celebrates a naval
expedition of the emperor’s; and not unlikely his British. Cæsar on
a galley with the eagle in his hand: the Genius of Rome follows him.
It is said, he was the first of the Romans that leaped on the British
shore: finding the soldiers slack in landing, he took a standard in his
hand, and went before them. Cæsar himself says the standard-bearer of
the tenth legion did so.

The coin was struck by him, when governor of some province under Cæsar,
probably Spain, where at Carthagena, in the Franciscan monastery,
remains his monument, thus in Gruter. MCCCCXXIII.

C. Trebonius was another legate, a commander of horse, mentioned B. G.
V. 17.

North of the church-yard is a square moted about, in length north and
south forty paces, in breadth east and west thirty; the entrance to the
west: it was originally the _prætorium_ of Mandubrace, king of London,
and of the _Trinobantes_. The ditches have been dug deep to make a
kitchen-garden for the rector of the church, from whom I suppose in
after-times it has been alienated. All the ground of the camp beyond
the _via sagularis_ was ever allotted to auxiliary troops, and allies.

This honour of a _prætorium_ was allotted to Mandubrace, now confirmed
in his kingdom, an associate of Cæsar’s, and friend declared to the
Roman commonwealth; and to give him more authority with his own people.

Hither Casvelhan was sent for, and reconciled to his nephew, enjoined
not to injure him, as an ally of Rome; assigned what tribute he should
annually pay, what number of hostages he should send to him into
Gaul: for now he was upon returning, having accomplished all that he
proposed, and the time of the autumnal equinox approaching. It was now
September, and 54 years before the vulgar Christian _æra_.

To the north of the eastern half of the camp, a bank and ditch marks
the outward bound there, in a strait line, and becomes crooked as it
goes eastward, just where ends the original northern bound of the
camp. To the south, where was the _frons castrorum_ at the houses of
the Brill, one would reasonably suppose, there might formerly remain
much more evident marks of the camp, as it is so far distant from the
_prætorium_: there might have been a more considerable _vallum_ and
ditch quite around the camp, than now any where appears; and then it
is natural to think, the name of the camp, as called by our Saxon
ancestors, the _Brill_, would be fixed to the habitable part, the
houses, as now.

In the first field of the duke of Bedford’s, by Southampton row,
the _vallum_ and ditch runs, which was drawn quite round London and
Southwark in the civil wars: they afterwards levelled it, and it is now
scarce discernible, which is but 100 years ago; Cæsar’s 1800.

  _Micat inter omnes Julium Sydus._]

Cæsar in his Commentaries, B. Gall. iv. 27. writes, the Britons, in
asking peace after being vanquished, brought some hostages according to
Cæsar’s command, and promised to bring the rest in a few days, as to be
fetched from more distant parts: in the mean time they disbanded their
armies; the princes of the country came from all quarters, recommending
themselves and their principalities to Cæsar. Hence it is obvious, he
staid here many days.

A bank is visible in the pasture between the Brill and end of
Copenhagen road, in the south-east pasture, the boundary of the camp:
we may discern, it is somewhat oblique, not in a true line with the
rest of the _frons castrorum_; but I suppose this owing to the curve of
the river eastward to Battle-bridge: they therefore made this bank in a
square to the river.

We may observe a portion still visible of the original boundary of the
camp eastward, in that part called _latera prætoria_, being at present
a watery ditch; and further downward, the foot-path between two banks
observes the like direction; and the ground of the _porta principalis_,
between them, is open and unfenced.

I judge, I have performed my promise, in giving an account of this
greatest curiosity of the renowned city of London; so illustrious a
monument of the greatest of the Roman generals, which has withstood the
waste of time for more than eighteen centuries, and passed unnoticed,
but half a mile off the metropolis. I shall only add this observation,
that when I came to survey this plot of ground, to make a map of it,
by pacing, I found every where even and great numbers, and what I have
often formerly observed in Roman works: whence we may safely affirm,
the Roman camp-master laid out his works by pacing. To give some
particulars.

The measure is taken from the inside of the ditch, or the line between
the _vallum_ and the ditch: the space of ground, which the camp-master
paces, the workmen throw inward to compose the _vallum_.

The camp on Barham downs contains in breadth thirty paces, length
sixty. The camp at Wrotham, in breadth thirty paces, in length forty.
At Walton by the Thames, it is a square of fifty paces. The foss here
is converted into a mote, as here the _prætorium_ of Mandubrace: so
the camp at Sheperton is a square of the same dimensions, and the foss
turned into a mote, and made an orchard: we observe here at Sheperton
the _prætorium_ is made on the bank of the river Thames; the _postica
castrorum_, beyond the _via sagularis_, neglected. While Cæsar was
pitched here, the turn of the auxiliaries to be in arms all night,
with the other part of the troops, whose duty it was, came on: and the
general’s intention was but to stay one night in this place; so there
was no need to mark out their places in the camp. The stakes placed
here in the river, by the Britons against Cæsar, were now a sufficient
security behind him. Cæsar practised the same method when he fought the
_Belgæ_: passing the river Axona, he placed his camp with the river
behind him, that he might not be attacked from that quarter.

Cæsar’s camp on Greenfield common is forty paces broad, sixty long.
Here he received the ambassadors of the _Trinobantes_, desiring their
prince Mandubrace to be restored: they bring forty hostages and
bread-corn for the army. For their reception another camp is made
around this, which is 80 paces broad, 100 long. Another day came in
ambassadors from the _Cenimani_, _Segontiaci_, _Ancalites_, _Bibroci_,
and _Cassii_. This obliged the camp-master to add the appendix to
the camps, which was of the breadth of 100 paces, equal to the length
of the last; 130 in length, stretching out to the east: but in the
ground-plot of that camp we see an egregious proof of my position,
that they went by paces in marking out their camps; and sometimes by
guess-work, in the square; which obliged the camp-master to carry his
130 paces beyond the angle of the former camp. Concerning the method
of adding new occasional works to a former camp, we observe a like
instance in that camp of Chlorus’s between Clarendon palace and Old
Sarum; made, we may well presume, on the states of Britain sending
their ambassadors hither to him, with submission to his government
after the destruction of Allectus.

Cæsar’s camp on Hounslow heath is very perfect, sixty paces square. His
camp at Kingsbury is thirty paces broad, and forty in length.

Come we now to our work at Pancras. The _prætorium_ is forty paces
broad from east to west, fifty paces long from north to south: the
_prætorium_ of Mandubrace is thirty paces long from east to west, forty
from north to south: thereby it accommodated itself to that part of the
camp, that was called _retentura_.

The breadth of the whole camp was 400 paces, not reckoning the valley
of the brook: the length of the whole is 500 paces. Examine the
intermediate parts, they fall into whole numbers: the breadth of the
pasture, comprehending the station of the _Hastati_ and _Triarii_, on
the west side of the camp, is 150 paces: that of the horse is forty
broad: the correspondent, or eastern part of the camp, is likewise 150
paces broad, comprehending the station of the _Triarii_ and _Hastati_;
so that, subducting the space of the valley where the brook runs,
the whole breadth of the camp, where the tents are pitched, contains
340 paces: a space beyond, on each side, of thirty paces wide, is
supposed to be left between the tents and the _vallum_, where a camp is
fortified: and then the camp contains just 400 paces broad.

The camp is in length 500 paces: the thirty paces beyond, for the way
between the tents and _vallum_, (where a _vallum_ is made) amounts to
560; so that the proportion of length to breadth is as 3 to 2; where
strength and convenience is well adjusted, and is often the proportion
of Roman cities. This space of ground was sufficient for Cæsar’s army,
according to Roman discipline; for, if he had 40,000 men, a third part
of them were upon guard.

The recovery of this most noble antiquity will give pleasure to a
British antiquary; especially an inhabitant of London, whereof it is a
singular glory: it renders the walk over the beautiful fields to the
Brill doubly agreeable, when, at half a mile distance, we can tread in
the very steps of the Roman camp-master, and of the greatest of the
Roman generals.

We need not wonder that the traces of this camp, so near the
metropolis, are so nearly worn out: we may rather wonder, that so much
is left, when a proper sagacity in these matters may discern them;
and be assured, that somewhat more than three or four sorry houses,
is commemorated under the name of the _Brill_: nor is it unworthy
of remark, as an evident confirmation of our system, that all the
ditches and fences now upon the ground, have a manifest respect to the
principal members of the original plan of the camp.

In this camp at Pancras, Cæsar made the two British kings friends;
Casvelhan, and his nephew Mandubrace: the latter, I suppose, presented
him with that corslet of pearls, which he gave to Venus in the temple
at Rome, which he built to her, as the foundress of his family.—_Pliny_
and _Solinus_.

Mr. White of Newgate-street has a gold British coin, found in an urn in
Oxfordshire, together with a gold ring set with a pearl.

When Cæsar returned, he found letters to him, acquainting him with his
daughter Julia’s death. _Plutarch._

I shall conclude with this observation, that on Cæsar’s return to the
continent, the _Morini_, inhabiting the opposite shore, lay in wait
for his men, hoping to obtain great spoils. This was in his first
expedition: it shows Britain was not so despicable a country as authors
generally make it: much more might they have expected it in return
from his second expedition, when the nations of the _Cattichlani_,
_Bibroci_, _Ancalites_, _Trinobantes_, _Cenimani_, _Segontiaci_, sent
ambassadors to him, seeking his favour; all charged with magnificent
gifts: and, beyond doubt, the Londoners were not slack, for so great a
favour as protecting them from the insults of Casvelhan, and restoring
to them their king Mandubrace.

Cæsar, having accomplished his purposes here, returned by Smallbury
green, in order to pass the Thames again at Chertsey. Smallbury green
was then an open place as now, and has its name from his _prætorium_,
like this at the Brill: the road lately went round it on the north
side; and gravel had long been dug from it, to mend the road; yet I
could discern part of it, till, three years ago, they made a new road
across the green, and totally ruined the _prætorium_. There is a spring
arises at the place.

It is fit we should say somewhat of the city of London, the glory of
Britain. Cæsar calls the inhabitants of this country _Trinobantes_:
it comprehends Middlesex and Essex on this side the river; Surry on
the other. The name of _Trinobantes_ is derived from _Trinobantum_,
the most ancient name of London: it signifies the city of the _Novii_,
or _Novantes_, the original name of the people called _Trinobantes_
by Cæsar. _Tri_, or _Tre_, in the very old British dialect, imports
a fortified city. Many names of this kind still remain, in Cornwall
especially.

_Noviomagus_ most certainly is Croydon in Surry. _Magus_ in British
signifies a city on a down, or heath. Newington on the South of London,
and Newington on the north, retain evident remains of the name of the
_Novantes_.

In many coins of the great king Cunobeline, nephew of our prince
Mandubrace, we have inscribed TASCIO NOVANTVM, meaning the tribute of
the Londoners, and of the people _Novantes_, dependent on them, called
by Cæsar _Trinobantes_.

The _Novii_, or _Novantes_, the original people of this country, knew
how to take the proper advantage of the noble river Thames, and built
this their fortified city of _Trinobantum_ upon a most convenient
situation, celebrated by all writers. The inhabitants of this potent
city carried on a very considerable trade with the continent, and
were rich and flourishing, as those numerous coins of Cunobeline
are evidences beyond all exception. _Londinium copia negotiatorum &
commeatuum maxime celebre_, says Tacitus. These coins are in gold,
silver, copper: I have engraved twenty-three plates of them. Nor, in
my opinion, have we reason to doubt of Billings-gate being built by
him, as his royal custom-house; and why Ludgate should not take name
from Immanuence Lud, father of our prince Mandubrace, I see not. The
business of a society of antiquaries is to separate truth from fable,
by evidence, by reason, and judgement. Authors are certainly mistaken
in thinking our British ancestors a rude and barbarous people. Need
we a further testimony of our continental trade, Cæsar speaks of the
Gaulish merchants who traded hither: he convened them together to
inquire concerning the nature of the country; and I have the strongest
reasons in the world to induce me to believe, that Britain was peopled
before the opposite continent, by a great and polite nation; and that
our British coins are the oldest of any in Europe.

Cunobeline, very young, was carried to Rome by his uncle Mandubrace,
four years after Cæsar’s expedition here, and his restitution to the
kingdom of the _Trinobantes_. Cunobeline became well acquainted, and
even intimate with Augustus, in the dawning of his power; being about
the same age. Augustus entertained a great kindness for him; and he
bore a share in his warfare, being præfect of a Roman legion, the XX.
VV. called _Cretica_, as Richard of Cirencester informs us; which is
the reason that he so often struck the figure of a boar on his British
coins, that being the ensign and cognisance of the legion. After
he returned, and was king of Britain, he kept up a friendship and
correspondence with Augustus, during his whole, and that a very long
life. He struck many coins in honour of Augustus, and the plainest
imitations of the coins of Augustus. He sent him magnificent presents,
paid a tribute to him, built the city Cæsaromagus in compliment to him.
He celebrated the Actiac games like those done by Agrippa at Rome, by
Herod at Cæsarea, and many other states of the Roman empire. By these
means he staved off, for his life, an actual subjection of Britain to
the Romans.

I cannot agree with my late learned friend Mr. Baxter in his derivation
of _Trinobantum_, that it is of Belgic original. The word _Tri_ or
_Tre_ of the old Cornish, prefixed, sufficiently confutes the notion:
here is none of the Belgic pronunciation, as in the west of England.
Cæsar’s assertion of the supereminent power of the _Trinobantes_, shows
they were an aboriginal people: they had indeed been under some sort of
subjection to the _Cassii_, or _Cattichleuni_; but that may have been
recent, when Casvelhan invaded them, and slew their king, his brother
Immanuence, father to our Mandubrace, as Cæsar tells us.

The very name of their neighbours, _Cattichleuni_, confirms our
opinion; signifying the clan of the _Cassii_; a most ancient word of
the Britons, equivalent to the Latin _civitas_, used by Cæsar; still in
use in Scotland. Baxter owns the _Cassii_ to be of Frisian, or British
origin.

This word _Frisian_ puts us in mind of the British stories of
_Trinobantum_ being _Troja nova_, built by the wandering Trojans: so
deep rooted among our ancestors is the notion of a Trojan original.
I know several foundations that may be assigned for this notion:
one seems to come from the utmost source of antiquity, the founder
of the British nation, APHER, grandson of ABRAHAM: for which I can
bring very large proofs, not so much pertaining to this place. He is
the Greek Phryxus, a near relation to Melicerta or Melcartus, the
Tyrian Hercules: he founded the Phrygians; he gave name to Africa,
and Britain; so that _Phrygii_, _Frisones_, and _Bryges_, _Britones_,
_Brigantes_, are all words in different pronunciation meaning the
same. Of it I say no more at present, than that it further illustrates
my opinion of the _Trinobantes_ being most ancient, an aboriginal
people here; and that their city was fenced about, whether with a
wall, or with a _vallum_, and ditch, I cannot pretend to say, any more
than when it was first called _Londinium_: and it is not my humour to
carry conjectures beyond what they will reasonably bear. But I think
I am not distant from truth, when I judge the _Novii_ to be the same
as the _Nubæ_ of Africa, on the west side the Nile; neighbour to the
_Troglodites_, says Strabo: these were neighbours too to the Arabians;
the Red sea between them: natural navigators they must needs be. And
Josephus makes the children of ABRAHAM by Keturah to be settled by him
in _Trogloditis_, and Arabia the Happy, upon the Red sea. _Antiq._ i.
15. The colony of these people at Cadiz is always said to come from the
Red sea. Pliny mentions the _Nubæi_, a people of _Arabia Deserta_.

Further, _Novantæ_ are a people in the west of Scotland, now Galloway.
_Novantum promontorium_, the Mull, _Chersonesus_, and _Novaritæ_;
and the city _Novantia_, north of Severus’s wall. The river Nid, in
Scotland, is called _Novius_. No reason to think either one or the
other of Belgic original, but undoubtedly a colony of our _Trinobantes_.

Josephus, in his xiv. of the antiquities of the Jews, gives us the
decree of the senate and people of Pergamus, in favour of the Jews;
setting forth, “Since the Romans, following the conduct of their
ancestors, undertake dangers for the common safety of mankind, and are
ambitious to settle their confederates and friends in happiness, and in
firm peace—”

The decree proceeds as at large set forth by Josephus, and well worthy
perusal; concluding, “That the Jews would remember, their ancestors
were friendly to the Jews, even in the days of ABRAHAM, who was the
father of the Hebrews; as we have also found it set down in our public
records.” Many useful observations may be made from this testimony.

1. We learn hence, mankind at that time, which was but about forty
years before the vulgar Christian _æra_, had the same notion of the
Romans, as I have enlarged upon in chap. 1. of the Medallic History
of Carausius. The Romans, for their valour, virtue, fortitude and
temperance, were the nation chosen by divine Providence to conquer,
polish, and set free, all the world, to prepare for the advent of
Messiah.

2. These Phrygians were a colony of the defendants of ABRAHAM by
Keturah. At Pergamus the ancient and famous physician Æsculapius had
a shop, and practised physic, as Lucian testifies. Midian, the father
of Phryxus, APHER, was a great physician, and no other than the Greek
Chiron; as I have shown elsewhere: so our Druids, the people of APHER,
were famous for medicine. The Genius of physic remained at the place:
the famous Galen was born here.

3. These people assert, what they say is written in their public
records; so that they had an early use of letters, from the Abrahamic
family: our Druids likewise had the use of letters from the same
fountain.

4. What they say is confirmed by the Lacedemonians claiming like
kindred to the Jews; as we read in Maccabees, xii. 19. 23. and
Josephus, xii. 4. 10. Mr. Whiston mentions, on this occasion, the
testimony of the Armenian writer, Moses Chorenensis; affirming that
Arsaces, founder of the Parthian empire, was of the seed of ABRAHAM,
by Keturah: and thus we find this posterity of the great patriarch,
from Britain by sea, to Parthia by land; the extent of the habitable
world: and Josephus often mentions his countrymen the Jews exceeding
numerous, in after-times, in every country and city throughout the
habitable world; which is true to this very day, both in respect to
Jews, properly speaking, by Sarah, as well as the Arabians by Hagar,
and Keturah: for by these latter all Asia and Africa are at this day
peopled: the signal favour of God to the greatest of all men, ABRAHAM.

Return we to the city of _Trinobantum_. I shall mark out the original
form, which we may conceive it to have been of, in the time we are
writing of. If we look on the plan of London, which I engraved long
ago in my _Itiner. Cur._ we discern, the original ground-plot of the
oldest part of the city is comprehended, in length, from Ludgate
to the present Walbroke; in breadth, from Maiden-lane, Lad-lane,
Cateaton-street, to the Thames. This makes an oblong square, in
proportion as 2 to 3: I have there made it to be composed of two
principal streets, crossing two other principal streets; which makes
nine principal quadrangular spaces, for the habitations, _area_’s, and
public buildings.

I have reason still to acquiesce in this disposition of the most
ancient city of London; as we must suppose it in the time of
Immanuence, father to Cæsar’s ally Mandubrace, whom he now resettled
therein. I am very much confirmed in my opinion, by the ground-plot
I have lately made of _Cæsaromagus_, now Chelmsford, built by
Mandubrace’s nephew, the great king Cunobeline, to the honour of
Augustus, his great friend and ally; for that city was exactly of the
same form and disposition.

Hence then we gather, the oldest London was bounded on the west by
Ludgate, and the wall there; on the east, by the current or rivulet
called Walbroke, coming from the morass of Moorfields; which morassy
ground extended to Smithfield, and guarded the whole north side of
the city; as the Thames on the south: it is well known, that the
Mansion-house stands on a great and deep morassy ditch; that the
foundation of it cost a very great sum, in driving piles, and the
like, to set the building upon. The city of London is situate much as
Alexander projected for Alexandria, between a morass and the sea.

Here was a natural and good boundary on all sides. To the west was a
steep cliff hanging over the rivulet of Fleet: its steepness is very
considerable now, as may be seen about the Old Bailey, where is at
present a flight of steps, through the old wall: in former days it
was much more considerable: the other sides had the river and water;
so that the spot pitched upon for the city must be reckoned very
judicious: the soil a hard and dry gravel.

There is the strongest confirmation for this assignment, deducible
from observing three principal roads leading from the gate of
Walbroke, at the end of the Poultry, at Stocks market, or the
Mansion-house: Cornhill was the great road directly into Essex:
Lombard-street conducted to Cunobeline’s custom-house, Billingsgate:
Threadneedle-street and Broad-street went obliquely toward the
north-east, and the present Bishops-gate, and so in later times to the
great Roman road called Hermen-street, crossing the Thames where London
bridge now is; making a meridian line through the length of the island.

By collating several old plans of London, I discern there were four
principal streets running from west to east. 1. The Watling-street,
from Ludgate. 2. Thames-street, the boundary toward the river: this
on the right hand of Watling-street. 3. On the left hand, Cheapside,
Pater-noster row being originally part thereof: at the end of it,
beyond the Poultry was the eastern gate of the city. 4. That called
Maiden-lane, and Cateaton-street, which was the northern boundary of
the city, and running along the original wall of it.

This being the first form of the city, its proportion of length to
breadth was as 3 to 2. Now, for the cross streets, I conceive one to
have been that of St. Martin’s lane from Aldersgate continued downward
to Paul’s wharf; the next was from Aldermanbury and Bow-lane, to
Queenhithe: the other, Walbroke to Dowgate, or Watergate, being the
outfall of the rivulet; boundary of the eastern wall of the original
city, as in in the time of Mandubrace. The street which accompanied the
western wall, on the inside Ludgate, is quite absorbed by houses at
present.

There might then have been many lesser cross streets both ways, of
which we cannot now take any account, our purpose being to consider it
only in the great; but there are many collateral indications of the
justness of our assignment: it would be a trifling minuteness to push
conjectures farther, than to observe the gate on the south side was at
Queen-hithe.

Thus we see a great conformity between old London and Cunobeline’s
_Cæsaromagus_, especially as to the general distribution and design;
the four gates of the sides corresponding to different streets
obliquely.

Afterwards, when the Romans became possessed of the island, and
made the great roads across the kingdom, three of them had respect
to this metropolis, but none went precisely through it; and such
was often their method. The Watling-street, from Chester to Dover,
came by Tyburn, crossed the Thames at Stanegate, by Lambeth, and
so to Shooters’ hill: this is crossed at Tyburn by another equally
strait, but unnoticed by any writer, reaching across the kingdom from
Chichester to Dunwich in Suffolk: I call it _via Iceniana_: it goes
by Old-street north of the city, and is the high road of Essex to
Colchester; but, when the Romans found it useful to enlarge this city
by a new wall, they made a branch to proceed from St. Giles’s, which we
call Holborn, and so built a gate at Newgate, and continued the road to
Cheapside.

A third road is the Hermen-street from the sea-side in Sussex to
Scotland: it went by Bishops-gate, but on the eastern and outside
of the city, till its enlargement; and that enlargement was done
by Constantine the Great, or by his mother the empress Helena, our
country-woman: and we may well credit the reports of the Britons
concerning this matter. Then it acquired the title of _Londinium
Augusta_: then it was that the Tower was built; an _armamentarium_, as
the castle of Colchester, of the same manner and model of building,
Roman brick and stone; a chapel with a semicircular window, as
Colchester, and dedicated to St. Helena. This in after-times; but in
regard to the age we are treating on, that of Cæsar and our aboriginal
Britons, it is a just enquiry, after we have given the plan of
primitive London of the _Novantes_, Where may we suppose their temple
to have been? for assuredly we must pronounce, that, whenever the
ancients built a city, they certainly took care to erect a temple for
divine worship.

In answer to this enquiry, we are to reflect, that the Britons
were under the ecclesiastic regimen of the Druids, who were of the
patriarchal religion, the religion indeed of ABRAHAM: for they came
from him. We find in sacred writ, wherever he removed from one country
to another, “there builded he an altar to Jehovah, and invoked in
the name of Jehovah,” who sometimes personally appeared to him:
consequently we must infer _Jehovah_ to be the Messiah, or Son of God,
in an angelic form.

Other times ABRAHAM removed into a country abounding with groves of
oak; sometimes he planted a grove of oak for religious purposes, as a
temple. All these things the Druids did; they built such open temples
as the great patriarch; they used oak-groves, or planted oak-groves as
temples: we cannot say that Jehovah appeared personally to them; yet we
may well think they were sometimes vouchsafed the spirit of prophecy,
and particularly in regard to Messiah, who they knew was to be born of
a virgin, and likewise was to be born at the winter solstice, whence
their famous misleto solemnity.

Moreover, at Chartres in France, which was the place of the principal
meeting of the Gaulish Druids, there is now a magnificent church, built
upon the spot where then was that most celebrated open temple: for the
Druids very easily passed over into christianity; the transition was
but natural. This church is dedicated to the Mother of God, as they
there style the virgin Mary: there is under it a chapel cut in the
rock, with a flight of stairs descending to it: on the door of the
frontispiece is this inscription in Latin,

    “To the Virgin who bears the Child.”

I apprehend this to be analogous to the caves of Mithras in Persia; for
_Mithras_ is Mediator, or Messiah; and they say there, that Mithras
was born in such a rocky cave; and they worship him therein. Both the
ancient Persians and the Druids, who were of the same patriarchal
religion, had the same notion of the Messiah to be born in the rocky
stable at Bethlehem.

We have many instances of Druid men and women endowed with the spirit
of prophecy. I shall mention but one, out of Josephus, Antiq. xviii.
The Jewish Agrippa fell into the displeasure of Tiberius, who put
him in bonds. As he stood leaning against a tree before the palace,
an owl perched upon that tree: a German Druid, one of the emperor’s
guards, spoke to him to be of good cheer, for he should be released
from those bonds, and arrive at great dignity and power; but bid him
remember, that when he saw that bird again, he should live but five
days. All this came to pass: he was made king by Caligula; St. Paul
preached before him: Josephus speaks of his death, agreeable to the
prediction. But concerning the Druids, I have before now opened my mind
largely, in some papers read at the Antiquarian Society; wherein I
have sufficiently vindicated them from the imputation of paganism and
idolatry.

As to the temple belonging to the city of _Trinobantum_, or London,
we may be assured, they erected no temple within the city. When the
Romans became masters here, they built a temple of their own form, to
Diana, where now St. Paul’s stands: they placed it in the open space,
then the _forum_; but the British temple, appropriate to the city, was
upon the open rising ground to the west, where now is Knave’s-acre.
The name of the place both gives a very good foundation to my opinion,
and also at the same time acquaints us with the particular form of the
temple: for the Druids, as I have shown, had three kinds of temples,
of the patriarchal mode. 1. The round, or circular work of upright
stones, innumerable to be seen. 2. The serpentine temple, or a snake
transmitted through a circle; as those of Abury and Shap. 3. The alate,
or winged temple, composed of a circle and wings: and this was the sort
of temple here placed; of which the name of _Knaves-acre_ is a sure
memorial. This was made only of mounds of earth, in Latin _agger_,
thrown out of the ditch camp-fashion: this word is corrupted into
_acre_. The word _knave_ is oriental, _canaph_, volavit; the _Kneph_
of the Egyptians; by which they meant the Deity, in the most ancient
times, before idolatry prevailed.

The form of our alate temple here exactly corresponds with that now to
be seen on Navestock common, Epping forest; which name of _Navestock_
preserves its memorial, meaning the sacred tree by the alate temple: it
is composed of mounds of earth and ditch; as ours was at Knaves-acre.

Observe, the word _agger_ remains at Edgeware, the _Suellanacis_ of
our king Casvelhan, uncle to Mandubrace: it is the Roman road called
Watling-street. Egham by Stanes acknowledges the like derivation, being
upon the _via Trinobantica_ at Stanes, the _Ad Pontes_ of the Romans.
Many more like instances I could give.

These sort of temples were properly dedicated to the Divine Spirit, the
author of motion, which moved upon the face of the new-created matter,
as Moses writes, and were more particularly assigned to the religious
festivity celebrated at the summer solstice, when the pigeon was the
first and peculiar sacrifice of the season. I shall not speak more
about them here: but besides this temple, the Britons had a magnificent
_cursus_, or place for sports and races on foot, in chariots, on
horseback, when they celebrated their public sacrifices and religious
observances on the solstices and equinoxes.

These _cursus_’s were likewise made of mounds of earth thrown up in
two parallel lines: such a one is that at Leicester in the meadow
near the river; it is called _Rawdikes_, from the ancient name of the
city, _Ratæ_, capital of the _Coritani_; such another there is, called
_Dyke-hills_, in the meadow of Dorchester, Oxfordshire, where the Tame
and the Isis unite; _Dobuni_.

Exactly such another, belonging to our _Trinobantum_, is that we call
_Long-acre_, or _agger_; which, we may be confident, was originally
two parallel banks, the whole length of that street, and breadth: it
has the same gentle sweep, or curve, as those other _cursus_’s: it
then commanded a beautiful prospect over the present Covent-garden to
the Thames, and an extensive view, both upward and downward, of the
river, and into Surrey. The banks were designed for the spectators, and
admirably well adapted to the purpose.

So that we may justly conclude, Knave’s-acre was the proper temple to
the city of _Trinobantum_, and Long-acre their solemn place of races,
accompanying the religious celebrations of the ancient citizens here,
in the time of Cæsar. Long-acre is 1400 English feet in length, which
is exactly 800 Druid cubits, two furlongs of the east, two _stadia_.

Give me leave to mention my fancy or conjecture of the founder of this
alate temple and _cursus_, viz. ELI, father of Immanuence, and of
Casvelhan: there was his _tumulus_ on Windmill-street edge, at the end
of Piccadilly: a windmill was erected on it in after-times. From it
descends the street called Hedge-lane, from _agger_, the _tumulus_. I
suppose the name of _Piccadilly_ may be from its elevation, a Hybrid
word composed from _peak cad Eli_, the _tumulus ducis Eli_. _Cad_ is a
common name of the Welsh kings.

Westminster, in Druid times, was a great wood, called afterward
Thorney-isle, where they celebrated the autumnal Panegyre. Mr. Denman,
a brass-founder, told me of three brass Celts dug up very low in the
foundation of the Sanctuary at Westminster, which he melted; they were
of whitish metal: also two more of the like, dug up in the bottom of
the Thames, on digging the foundation of Westminster bridge, which he
melted.

I shall only add a few observations, more than what is already done,
concerning the plan of the oldest city of London. Where now is St.
Paul’s was the _forum_, or market-place, comprehending the square
_area_ between Cheapside, the Old ’Change, Watling-street, and where
now is the west end of St. Paul’s. The highest end of the city was the
north-west corner, guarded by a steep precipice, where Madan-lane is,
which imports as much. The north side of the city had a deep ditch,
always filled with water from the morass of Moorfields and Smeethfield,
now Smithfield. From hence the name of Lade-lane; for _lade_, in Saxon,
is an artificial ditch, or drain: and this discharges the vulgar
opinion of Ludgate taking its name from the river Flete, as if _porta
flumentana_. Now we may well assert Dowgate to be truly such, the
water-gate.

Our Saxon ancestors had some remembrance of the enlargement of London
walls, by their naming of Aldgate, and Aldersgate, as sensible of the
priority of one in date. It was A. D. 450, that they beat the Scots
at Stamford, which is but little more than 100 years from the time of
Constantine the Great, when these walls were built, and the title of
_Londinium Augusta_ commenced. That the city-walls were made by the
empress Helena, is strongly confirmed by the history of the recovery of
Britain to the Roman empire by Constantius Chlorus: for Asclepiodotus
his general fought the Britons under the dominion of Allectus, under
the old walls of London, at Walbrook, then the eastern boundary
of the city, as historians particularly recite; and we may easily
believe Cornhill to have been originally without the city, where the
waggons stood that brought it. The historians likewise tell us, that
the first palace of the British kings was in the south-west corner
of the city, where afterwards Baynard’s castle stood, which likewise
became a palace of our kings, before Bridewell was built: but when
the empress Helena built the walls of the enlarged city, which walls
for the most part now remain, the palace was then the present tower.
Lastly, I apprehend, the oldest city which we are describing was walled
about; for I cannot allow the Britons to be any wise inferior to the
Gauls in art, either military or civil. When the city was enlarged and
incompassed with new walls, the three roads beyond the east gate were
converted into streets, as at present, Threadneedle-street, Cornhill
and Lombard-street; as well as the Roman road, Gracechurch-street.




                             ITER BOREALE.


In the year 1725, I travelled over the western and northern parts of
England, in company of Mr. Roger Gale, a gentleman well known to the
learned world; as his father, Dr. Thomas Gale, dean of York. I was
requested, by some lovers of antiquity, to transcribe those notes
which I wrote day by day during our journey; and though I had visited
several of the places, through which we passed, in my former journeys,
yet a second view (especially in company of a person so well versed in
antiquities) gave me an opportunity of making some farther remarks,
which I flatter myself may be of use to those who are fond of studying
the antiquities of our own country.

       *       *       *       *       *

I shall begin with Dunstable, the MAGIOVINIVM of the Romans. Many large
brass coins, and many silver, are found in ploughing the fields here,
and when digging in the ruins of the old priory by the church: I got a
Nero of Corinthian brass, and a Faustina. The downs here are but a rib
or narrow ridge of chalk; or northward is sand or clay.

Madan castle is circular, perhaps oval: the space within is a fine
plain: the _vallum_ is small, and the ditch much smaller; so that I am
persuaded it was made rather for spectacle than defence. Tethill castle
is a little further westward, a strong little camp upon one of the many
north-west precipices of chalk exceeding steep: a village underneath,
and springs of water: it is a double camp, both square; in one a round
keep, or large _tumulus_ ditched about, which shows it is a Saxon work.

The prospect all along the steep northern sides of the Chiltern hills
is lovely; the Icening-street goes at the bottom; it is corn-field for
the most part. These hills are all steep westward and northward.

Brick hill, or more properly Brink hill, stands on a very high sandy
hill, steep north-west: the Watling-street, just before it arrives
here, winds a little eastward, to avoid a deep valley, and passes above
it.

Stone begins beyond Brick hill; and we enter a country of long-extended
ridges, with large valleys and rivulets at bottom.


                               DAVENTRY.

The country here, which is probably the highest in England, is a quarry
of reddish stone, in small _strata_; the uppermost very full of shells,
especially _belemnites_. The air must needs be exceeding good, as in
the centre of England; the soil is a reddish clay. This is a neat
pleasant town, well situate: two springs of the Avon run close by it.
Eastward the great hill whereon is Borough-hill camp: a very pretty
spring arises in the inner ditch, probably the highest in England; it
is on the north-east side, which way the hill declines. This camp is
on that end of the hill which it fills up, and conforms to its shape;
double ditched, but toward the entrance the ditches separate, and meet
at the entrance obliquely, after a manner I have not seen elsewhere.
All round the mid-way of the hill it is boggy and springy: the whole
hill is stone. Upon it are many more works of great compass; I suppose,
some later camps of the Danes, Saxons, or Britons against them: there
seem to have been some entrenchments round that part of Daventry town
where the church stands: the inner ditch of the first-mentioned camp is
very broad, and the _vallum_ proportionable. Spellwell is the name of
the spring on Borough hill; it looks blue: they say it is good for sore
eyes, and is a great dryer.

                   *       *       *       *       *

It is a stony and clayey soil all the way from Daventry to Warwick: the
country is open and full of corn-fields. The river divides countries of
different nature; for on the other side it is a very good sort of large
rocks: the country is very woody.


                        PRAESIDIVM. +Warwick.+

There seem to be signs of a camp on the east side of the river,
over-against the castle, in a close where is an old chapel now become
a barn: a spring riles a little above it: if so, then this was the
garrison before the Romans built the city on the west side. Warwick is
a very neat and beautiful town; many fine houses and public buildings
of good stone, dug up at hand. The old castle is very perfect, and a
noble seat: many fine pictures of the Greville family, and others,
particularly an original of Sir Philip Sidney: the whole length of
the place is one suite of rooms very magnificent; one wainscotted
with cedar: they all look over the river. One may see here much of
the ancient manner of fortification: their methods of defence, two
gates, two portcullices at the entrance; with hole to drop down poles,
and an immense strength of stone-work: before the towers at the gates
are iron hooks fastened into the wall, which they told us were for
hanging wool-sacks on in a siege: a tower in the corner of each wing,
very high; that at the corner next the river they call Cæsar’s tower,
made of three circular segments; that at the corner next the town is
twelve-angled, called Guy’s tower: the keep is very high, now made
with a circular walk to the top. At the priory, in two galleries
which seem to be part of the first building, are some paintings on
glass, of religious stories. The chapel at Guy’s cliff is double,
having two arches within, that divide its length into two ailes or
chapels. Under the castle-walls, by the river side, upon the rock grows
much liver-wort, thriving in so agreeable a place. I observed the
lowermost rocks are perpetually dripping, which gathering together in
a channel underneath, makes a small rivulet. This seems to indicate,
that fountains are the effect of exudation from the most elevated
protuberances into some internal cavity; which though by drops only,
yet the sum amounts to enough to make a spring run perpetually; as
the alembic distills the vapors. Now the tops of the hills are kept
always moist by the natural ascent of the water below. I know nothing
against this doctrine, but springs arising in very large quantity from
narrow apexes, and where no other higher ground is near, if any such
springs there be: but we want sufficient number of instances and _data_
to determine this great question. People since the creation have been
very negligent, or very injudicious, in making observations for this
purpose. This is not an useless inquiry; for if we found out Nature’s
method in this affair, it would assist in making artificial springs, or
finding out natural ones, to the great enrichment of barren lands, and
watering all in a dry season; water being the universal instrument of
all increase and nutrition.

Warwick bridge has twelve arches. The _potamogeiton majus_ grows in
the river; a large yellow flower, tripetalous, with an apple like the
Egyptian _lotus_.


                               COVENTRY.

Dr. Philemon Holland, who translated Camden’s _Britannia_, is buried in
the choir of Trinity church. In the window is a piece of painted glass
of Leofric earl of Chester, lord of this place, and Godiva his wife:
he holds a charter in his hand with this writing, _I Luryche for love
of thee grawnte Covet̄re tol fre._ Stichell, a mile south of Coventry,
has its name from the clays. The road here is paved very broad for a
great length. St. Michael’s church is a very stately and magnificent
building: the spire is very fine, and the highest of any I have seen
for its base, but built of a mouldering stone. Over-against it is the
town-house, a large stone building, and old, like a church: a very old
wooden chair there, said to be that wherein king John was crowned;
much old rusty armour; pictures of several kings of England, and other
benefactors; and many inscriptions, Latin and English, relating to
them. A vintner bought some ground north of St. Michael’s, and built
a house upon it: he dug up great ruins of the old convent, and many
coffins, and among the rest (as they say) that of Leofric and Godiva.
This is a very large and populous city, but narrow irregular streets;
and the houses chiefly of wood, and very old, hanging over the streets.
The gates are many and stately: no doubt the walls were answerable, but
now demolished for the most part, after the rebellion: in some places,
where parcels are left, it is very thick, and so strong, that they only
undermined it, and threw it down flat; as particularly in the meadows
north of St. Michael’s, where it passed over the brook by an arch.
Between that and the church stood the priory, founded by Leofric before
the Conquest: some old walls of it remain. Here have been many elegant
brasses in the churches, but broke up. The famous Cross is of a pretty
model, but of perishing stone. The basis of St. Michael’s steeple is
but twelve yards from outside to outside of the buttresses. Every road
hence is paved with a broad high-raised causeway, from every gate a
mile.

Griff coal-works here, forty ells deep, of vast compass. No sort of
fossils found in them. _Griff_, from _grave_, _grooff_, digging. The
soil sandy from Coventry hither, then black earth. The coal-mine
runs from Coventry to Tamworth in a line: here are such breaches
that intercept the _strata_, and such trapping and dipping as in
Somersetshire: the fissures, upon breaking the track and parallelism of
the _strata_, make them diverge generally. Great old toads are often
found in the solid coal, leaving a cavity of their own shape. They draw
away the water from the mines by an invention originally of the earl of
Worcester, improved by Captain Savery and others: it works with a vast
power from the atmosphere pressing into a receiver exhausted of air, by
vapor, and then condensed. I saw the ruined chapel of Nuneaton. Many
religious houses thereabouts, and remains of camps, castles, &c. and
nothing else can make amends for the badness of the roads.


                             MANDVESSEDVM.

Dugdale says, divers Roman coins of brass and silver have been found
here. It stands on the river Anker. The first syllable of the name
remains, _Man_-castle or ’cester. At Oldbury a square fort of thirty
acres, with very high rampires, situate on an eminence: this, no doubt,
was a camp: to the north of it have been found frequently flint axes of
the old Britons, about four inches and a half broad, ground to an edge:
there are no flints within forty miles of the place. Either our maps
are wrong, or the Roman road goes very much winding, perhaps to avoid
the great Arduen forest. The name of this forest left in divers places,
Weston in Arden, Henly in Arden, Ardbury, &c.

I called on Mr. Henry Beighton, an ingenious gentleman, who is making
a map of this county; and we visited this station. South a little of
the bridge, under which the Anker passes the Watling-street, I found
the old city: it lies on both sides the road, and is of a square
form: the road passes exactly through the middle of its length, which
is 600 foot, its breadth 200, on each side the road. The field in
Leicestershire is called Old-field banks; that in Warwickshire, Castle
banks. The ditch is very perfect quite round, and the bank whereon
stood the wall. The people know of great stones, and mortar work
exceeding strong, being dug up; much Roman brick, iron, and great
numbers of coins brass and silver, and some gold: in sinking wells the
like things found. Several vaults go quite through, and cattle have
sometimes dropt into them. A spring at the north-east gate. Oldbury
is a great camp upon a high hill, west of the place; whence a most
delightful prospect. The hill whereon stands the church of Mancester,
which is a field or two off the bridge, seems to have been a camp too:
it is intrenched very deeply, but I cannot say with so much regularity,
as to its present appearance, that will ascertain it to the Romans:
it is in the way to Oldbury. The houses reached from the castle to
the bridge; for in the ploughed piece between, called the Furlong,
foundations have been discovered, and many bridges. A great family has
lived at Mancester, and of that name, who probably made, or altered,
the ditches there. Geo. Astley esq. of Wolvey, near High-cross, has a
great collection of coins found at High-cross, and all the neighbouring
places; as Monks Kirby, where urns and ashes have been often found. The
prospect from Oldbury is exceeding extensive all over the country; the
camps of Shugbury, Arbury, and Borough, all in view, and the country
that way, where the Watling-street runs, as far as Watford gap; so all
into Nottinghamshire, and westward to a great distance. Withersley, and
several villages round, parish to Mancester as their mother-church.
The church there is a pretty large building with a tower-steeple. The
country there is all a rock, and abounds with springs: the rock is
of very hard stone, and dips westward, as the adjacent coal-mines.
Mancester stands on much higher ground than the road and old city. More
coal-mines about Dudley, Wolverhampton in Staffordshire. Sometimes the
ends of the coal at those breaches bend the contrary way: this shows
the breaches were made before the coal was perfectly hardened. When the
damps exanimate a man at these coal-pits, they draw him up instantly,
and make a round hole in the earth, put his head in, and cover it with
fresh mold, which infallibly restores him. Between Wormleighton and
Stanton they found, in a pit, a trunk of a tree hewn into a coffin,
with bones in it; and many coins, particularly of Constantine. At
Wolfencote, upon the Leam, in sinking a well they came to a vault with
urns and coins: in digging at the priory at Coventry they found the
old cloysters, with many grave-stones of monks; and in the old walls,
which were very thick, bones and skulls with teeth, &c. were laid in,
as fillings-up, from ruins of the older monastery.


                              BIRMINGHAM.

A large rich town, the very shop of Vulcan. The vicinity of the
coal-mines has made it the chief place in England for all sorts of
iron work, sent hence throughout the whole world, in great abundance:
it is a pleasant, woody, plentiful country hereabouts: they have
repaired an old church, and built a new one: the streets are large and
good buildings: there is a pretty square, inclosed and planted like
Soho: the town lies on a declivity. In the old church are tombs, in
alabaster, of a Jerusalem knight, two other knights, and some others.
Deritend chapel built of timber, 5 R. II. by the river side. Here is a
large school-house founded by Edward VI. not long since rebuilt: they
have marked out large tracts of ground on the hill round the new church
for buildings.

I find the Rigning-street way comes from Alcester, directly north
and south, by Moseley, over a heath where the road appears now very
broad, on the east side of the rivulet Rea: it descends Camp hill, and
passes the river by the present bridge, and the valley where the low
and old part of the town stood: it makes an angle in order to pass
this broad meadow, directly as the Icening-street does at Newbury,
or _ad Spinas_. No doubt but here was a station in the time of the
Romans, because a convenient distance, ten miles from _Etocetum_: but
of its name I know no footsteps. I imagine the present name derived
from the great quantity of broom growing all round. _Ingham_ signifies
the dwelling upon the meadows; for the town has advanced itself but
by degrees up the hill. When the Roman road has passed the valley, it
turns up the first street on the right hand (Park street) to take the
most convenient rise up hill, and at the end of the town falls into
the present road, with its former direction to _Etocetum_. Probably
upon Camp hill has been a camp, being by the road side, and having a
fine prospect: what with the deep roads to Coventry and Warwick, here
meeting the Ricning; and the inclosures, and digging for brick and
tile, I could discern no signs of it. At this town is a considerable
manufacture for thread. Beyond Birmingham, the Rigning-way runs upon
the division between the counties of Stafford and Warwick, by Aldston.

In the forges here, three men beat together with successive strokes;
which brought into my mind Virgil’s

    _Brontesque, Steropesque, ac nudus membra Pyracmon._


                               ETOCETVM.

A little to the west of where the Rigning crosses the Watling-street,
south-west of Litchfield stands a little village, called Wall; south
of that a quarter of a mile is Chesterfield. This is said to be the
oldest city in England, by the inhabitants; and the Watling-street the
oldest road. The Itinerary of Antoninus sufficiently evinces the place
to be _Etocetum_. Part of the Rigning-way, northward hence, is very
fair, with a high strait bank; part very mirey and bad. The country is
sandy, clay, and full of round coggles, of which the road was composed.
The Watling-street eastward hence about half a mile is inclosed in
fields; but westward it appears very strait and broad. They call the
Rigning the Hickling street at this place; and likewise Port-lane: it
goes to Burton upon Trent. Many Roman coins found here, both great
and small. Mr. Quintin, living here, has many: he owns the field
called the Butts, where I saw great ruins of walls equidistant twelve
foot, and twelve high, like square cellars. I saw bits of pavement
there, Irish slate, Roman bricks, some pieces thus marked [ornate
cross]. The walls are a yard thick, of strong mortar, rubble stone,
&c. The Watling-street parts the two villages, Chesterfield south,
and Wall north. By the side of a road going northward thence to Pipe
hill, I immediately espied the Roman walls, notorious by the manner
of their structure; of rag-stone, a course laid sloping this way, a
course that way, with very strong and white mortar: this lies under
a hedge, and the roots of old oak-trees for the length of a hundred
yards, till intercepted by a dwelling-house. They say the building in
Butt’s close was a temple; and probably they are not mistaken. The
Watling-street at this old city goes precisely east and west: some
mile-stones found by the brook running west of the city: a pretty
spring there; ruins upon digging all the fields round: the brook has a
broad marsh along it westward. A little below the temple, we saw the
crown of a subterraneous arch in the hedge. They showed me where the
Rigning-way went through a corn-field south of the castle, and passed
the river west of Shenston: it is a field way still southward, and an
open road north. The castle stood in the north-west angle, between the
Watling and another road, going to Litchfield, upon a gentle southern
declivity: the old walls are founded upon the solid rock, and much
more of them was left within memory: now they pull them down to build
withal. There is a gate crosses the Watling-street at the castle end,
by the side of the other road. That called the Temple is upon the
western declivity, much lower in elevation than the castle, which is
upon the highest ground in the neighbourhood, and somewhat raised
above the common level, by heaps of rubbish, and foundations, which
I could discern above ground in the orchard. The place of this old
city is an elevation, and has a good prospect, especially southward:
Oldbury castle and Mancester are in view. Wm. Milner, at the Swan,
is an antiquary, and knows the old name of the place: he showed me a
Roman wall in his cellar, and says it goes far backward by the garden.
No doubt there were houses all the way, on both sides the road, from
the castle to the brook, which is a sweet descent westward. There was
a Roman coin of gold found near Hales-Owen. Many floors, pots, and
other antiquities, found on the south side the Watling-street, in
the ploughed fields called Chesterfield Crofts; and a very fine red
earthen ware, with figures of bucks upon them. The circumference of the
castle is hardly to be found; the ground has not been dug in the yards
hereabouts. The Rigning-way goes by Lyn-lane, and so passes the river
west of Shenston, at Shenston nether town. This country lies upon a
rock here and there interspersed, but not a good stone; but there is
a quarry of good free-stone, of a brown colour, by Swinfield. I saw a
Nero of Corinthian brass, and some square Roman pavements found there.

The Rigning runs on the east side of an eminence called Mawcop hill,
as it passes northward hence. The building in Butts close is level
at top with the pasture, except toward the declivity, where they have
dug away the earth, and the great wall that ran along it. Two miles
beyond _Etocetum_, on the top of a hill is Knave’s castle, on the
south side the Watling-street: it is a large _tumulus_ inclosed within
three ditches; an entrance on the south side: it has been hollowed at
top. This is in a vast moor, or common full of heath, as the nature of
the soil is all the way. The Watling is very fair and strait, and in
many places the ridge is perfect for a great length. A little west of
the bridge, under which the river Penk crosses the Watling, are a few
houses belonging to Stretton, upon an eminence. This is thought to be
the


                             PENNOCRVCIVM.

And, no doubt, it was hereabouts, to answer the miles in the Itinerary.
The village of Stretton lies a little to the north of the road; and
a mile south is Brewood, another village, which they say has been an
old city: it lies upon the Penk. Upon ploughing the fields they find
Roman coins frequently, and much other antiquities. In that great old
city, king John kept his court. A little brook runs a pasture or two
below the road, and parallel to it, into the Penk, called Horse brook:
it is a very full river, and the bridge is broad it runs through.
The Watling-street is here east and west. Three large stone bridges
cross the river in two miles. The old Roman city, no doubt, was by the
road-side somewhere near here, and perhaps by Horse brook. Brewood
may have been a Roman town, but it is too far out of the road for
the convenience of travellers; and Penkridge is two miles and a half
off, so that it can put in no claim. This town must have borrowed its
name from the river, as that from the Roman city. Penkridge stands by
the side of a large marsh made by the river: the church is built of
good stone; a remarkable stone cross in the street. The healthiness
of this country favours Mr. Baxter’s conjecture of the derivation of
_Pennocrucium_.

The prospect hence southward is noble, and very comprehensive. Dudley
castle, and many of the steep summits of the hills in Worcestershire,
are in view; together with the mighty height of the Wrekin, which, from
a plain, rises like a sugar-loaf to a narrow tip, and of very difficult
ascent. The Watling-street runs under it. It is good land here, warm
and woody, being just beyond the moor.


                               STAFFORD.

The castle here to the north west, a mile and half off, stands on a
tip of rising ground very steep to the north-west; on which they have
raised a keep, or high mount of earth: on that stood a square tower of
stone, part of which remains. Here is the most magnificent prospect
quite round, that one can imagine; the Malvern, the Wrekin, and many
Welsh mountains, lift up their narrow heads beyond the utmost horizon,
and above the clouds, as it seems. To the eastward is room for the
castle, fenced too with a deep ditch. This was the work of Edward the
elder, in the Saxon times; or rather his sister, the virago Elfleda,
A. D. 913. A little church stands near the castle, called the Castle
church, with a house or two near it. The situation of Stafford is low,
in a broad marshy vale, where several rivers meet; and it has been
fortified quite round, the waters of the rivers favouring that purpose.
Two miles directly eastward is Beacon hill, a large parcel of rocks
laid upon a level eminence, and covered with grass, having a steep
ascent on every side, like a camp: it has a very pleasant prospect.
The town-house here is a handsome large building. Upon St. Amor heath,
under Beacon hill, a battle was fought in the civil wars.

We passed through Uttoxeter, where I could find nothing Roman,
notwithstanding its name, _cester_; only heard of three gold coins
found by the river side, not far off, some time since: it stands in
a very fine country, watered by the Dove, a fruitful river, running
through large meadows. Thence, in our way to Derby, we saw several
large, flat Celtic barrows, upon a common at Sidbury. We rode over
the meadows under Tutbury castle, famous for the bull-running on Aug.
10. where the people of two counties meet according to ancient usage,
and contend for the honour of their counties, sometimes to bloodshed.
The castle, once the seat of the dukes of Lancaster, stands on a very
high precipice, looking north and west, strong by nature and art;
very probably a Roman camp originally, as its name, _bury_, imports:
it is not far from the Rigning-way. _Tot_ signifies an eminence.
Underneath it we went through Hilton. The lord of the manor there held
of the dukes, by a ridiculous appearance before him, on the day after
Christmas, whilst Jack of Hilton blowed the fire. Of this, of the
king of the fidlers, of the bull-running, &c. see a large account in
Dr. Plot. Mr. Gale says, this Jack of Hilton was a Saxon idol, called
_Pouster_: it was made of brass, hollow, with a little hole, which when
filled with water, and set before the fire, as an æolipile, vented
its contents in vapor, rarified with great force. This was a good
philosophical trick to delude the vulgar, and would appear like magic
to them, ignorant of the cause.

Mr. Prescot of Chester showed us the impression of an _intaglia_ found
at Uttoxeter.

A mile and half off Derby we fell into the Rigning-street coming
from Burton; which, leaving Derby a little on the east, passes over
Nun-green to _Derventio_: there it crossed the river on a bridge, and
thence went to Chesterfield.


                              DERVENTIO.

I find the Rigning proceeds over the common, by the mill and brook at
the west end of Derby, and falls into a valley, which gives a gentle
descent to the river side, every where else steep, over-against the
old city: this, no doubt, is the reason why the Romans placed it
in that very spot. The river is very broad and deep, equal to the
Medway at Maidstone; the sides steep, so that a ford was not at all
practicable: it is six or seven foot deep here at least. Darley slade
is the name of the valley where the descent of the road is: they call
the road the Foss hereabouts; which shows that no more is meant by
the name, than that it is an artificial work: the Foss and Rigning
therefore are but synonymous terms. A little up the river, beyond the
city, was the bridge: in time of a frost, when there is clear ice,
they can see the foundation of the piers very plainly, and a piece of
one is still left. Thence the road proceeds over the pasture, where,
after a fortnight’s dry weather in summer, they can distinguish it by
the parched grass: it goes up the valley north of Bradsal, by Priory
Hall, so to Chesterfield. Another such way, they say, went up the hill
directly from the street of the city by Chadsden: part of it has been
dug up near the town by the Crown ale-house, and its ridge is still
visible. In the pasture over-against the house two square Roman wells
were opened by a violent flood in Sir Simon Degg’s time: they were
made of very broad flat stones, let into one another, and were paved
at bottom with bricks set edge-wise, as they tell me. Roman coins are
found in every road, foot-path, and ditch, about the town: they never
dig in the gardens, or pastures, but they find them, together with
rings and other antiquities. A man who kept the Duke’s-head ale-house
found seven score at a time in digging a hole to set a post in but they
are all dispersed. The city of _Derventio_ is in possession of the
deanery of Lincoln: the city walls were dug up in great quantities to
mend the ways with but they were so strong, they were forced to blow
them up with gunpowder. There is much painted glass in Morley church,
a mile beyond Bradsal, and tombs of the Sacheverels. A piece of the
wall of _Derventio_ is left under Mr. Hodgkinson’s garden-house. I saw
a piece of a vase of coral-coloured earth found there, also several
pieces of pillars; and they meet with foundations wherever they dig.
Mrs. Hodgkinson showed us a gold Anastasius, _victoria aug. g. g._ said
to be found near Leicester and a silver Arcadius. I saw a large brass
coin, found at Derventio, _Diva Faustina_. I find this city is exactly
of the same dimensions as _Manduessedum_, 120 paces long, 80 broad.

I rode to the hill south of Littleover, upon the Rigning-way, which
lies in a strait line under the eye as far as _Etocetum_, and the hills
beyond it. Litchfield cathedral appears a little to the west of it.
The valley of the Trent, by Burton, is bounded on each hand by great
heights. Repton, the burial-place of Ethelbald and other Mercian kings,
is in view. From the other side of the hill, north of Littleover, the
road butts upon the valley of Bradsal, by Priory hall, directly over
_Derventio_. The Rigning is the common road from Burton to Derby, till
a little north of Littleover it descends the hill to the left of the
common road, which there is drawn to the right on account of Derby. I
saw a great number of coins found here; Trajan, Carausius, _pax aug._
Victorinus, Magnentius, Dioclesian, Valens, &c. Mr. Hodgkinson gave
me a Constantine, _soli invicto comiti_, struck at London. I measured
the _castrum_ with exactness: it is 600 foot long, 500 broad. We
saw the wall on the outside Mr. Lord’s house: the mortar is full of
pebbles as big as nuts, but excessively hard. Darley Slade is a fine
descent for the road. We saw the admirable silk-looms again: there
is a large additional building to them. The five churches here have
all tower-steeples: the new one, a spacious and neat pile; the tower
belonging to it, of old work, is stately. There is an old chapel on the
bridge. A weak chalybeat water was found out lately, two miles off. The
market-place is a pretty square.

Entering the Peak country, where the rocks begin, we saw two _tumuli_
on the edges of two opposite hills. We came by the great rock called
Radcliff, where the hermitage is: these and the neighbouring rocks
have a frightful appearance: on the back of them are some stones set
upright, two and two, as if the remains of a Celtic avenue. All around,
the hills are big with lead ore. The cattle drinking the water here are
liable to a distemper called the _belon_: it is owing to the mercury
that falls in the smoak of the smelting-mills: they become asthmatic,
and frequently run mad. Cats, dogs, and poultry, are seized with it.


                               BAKEWELL.

This town seems to be Roman, and possibly its name was _Braciaca_,
because of the inscription found near here in Camden, DEO MARTI
BRACIACAE. There is a large tall stone in the church-yard, raised on a
pedestal, as a cross, with engravings, very ancient, of George and the
dragon, a crucifix and other things, with flower-work: it is eight foot
high, besides the pedestal. The church is a large handsome building,
but in very bad repair; a spire-steeple upon an octagonal tower, and
that set on a square one; the whole in the middle of the church; the
choir large: an alabaster tomb before the altar, of one of the family
of Vernon: the south transept has, in a large chapel, many tombs of
the Vernons, and Manners’s, ancestors of the duke of Rutland, but in a
ruinous condition: many other old tombs; a knightly one of Colepepper,
one of Foljamb, &c. a very ancient font with images, as rudely cut as
those on the cross. The church stands much higher than the town. The
Wye is a very rapid river; it never overflows, so great is the descent
from it. The castle is a square plot of high ground, with a large
_tumulus_ hollow at top. I cannot affirm there is any thing Roman. This
town stands in a flat valley, where the river passes in meanders; and
the prospect every way is very romantic. A cold bath at the Angel inn,
arched over, and made very convenient. Derbyshire marble wrought here,
very beautiful, bears a good polish, full of _belemnites_ and other
curious shells petrified together.


                              CHATSWORTH.

We reviewed this noble seat of the duke of Devonshire’s. The front of
the house is a fine design; the colour of the stone agreeably overcast
with a faint redness. Several antique marbles: upon the pedestal of a
busto this inscription, _P. Ælius Aug. libertus. Lycus fecit Solusæ
libertæ suæ._ a sepulchral urn.

Another, _Dis manibus Ti. Claudi thalliani Vix. Ann._ XX. _dieb._ XX.
_Claudia felicula Mater filio piissimo._

The canal hewn out of the rock is made where a great hill was: now
it opens a beautiful prospect towards Winster: it is 325 yards long,
25 broad: the hill was 44 foot high: the cascade is 212 yards long,
with 23 breaks. There is an admirable antique Plato in the duke’s
library, like that at Wilton; and a cast of Hobbes from the life: also
an antique ram’s head. The painting about the house is by Verrio, la
Guerre, Thornhill: the gallery is a curious room, painted by Cheron.
Vast quantities of Derbyshire marble, of all colours, and beautiful.


                                BUXTON.

Just before we come to this place, on the right hand is a square
_vallum_, ditch inward; both small, about fifty feet each side:
eastward adjoins a roundish space, marked out in the same manner.
There are barrows upon the tips of the hills hereabouts. We found
infinite quantities of shells among the stone: but the _belemnites_
are most frequent; they are dropped as it were into the superficies
of the stone, while soft, with the points downwards. The soil of this
country is sandy and rock: the whole superficies of it is a rock, whose
_strata_ lie every where parallel to the declivity of the ground: it is
lime-stone, like that at Bath; but the layers of it are much thicker.
One may guess hence, that this sort of stone by some means procures the
warmth of the waters.

We saw Mam Torr from hence seven miles; a steep huge rock elevated
above the hills. There is a great yawning between two rocks split as it
were from top to bottom: on the precipice of one jaw is an old castle,
whence the adjacent town Castleton. Between it is the great cavern
called the Devil’s Arse. A few little houses under the very rock. This
country is fruitful in what we may call the _magnalia naturæ_. By these
wonders of the Peak, and the warm waters, people are tempted to visit
these wild wastes. At a place called Hope I learnt there are some
stones, called Marvel-stones, which cannot be numbered: I guess them to
be a Celtic temple. I could not hear of those at Chelmerton, though I
fancy there must be such, because of some barrows on the hills looking
that way: it requires some time, labour, and hazard, to hunt them out,
by reason of the rockiness of the country. The sides of the hills,
where the villages are, are divided into closes by stone walls, as in
other places by hedges.

We went into Pool’s Hole again. This cavern rises, as we go farther in,
with the hill: the stones within are covered over with petrifaction,
from the water distilling down: some of the icicles are three or four
yards long, hanging from the roof; the slow accretion of ages: the
springs dribble down every where, as draining through the _strata_
into this cavity. I fancy there are such in most rocky hills, and they
cause springs: for we may conceive that after the harder shell of a
hill was condensed, and first, as being outermost and more exposed to
the external heat, in the infant globe; the internal parts, when they
came to harden afterwards, by attraction of so much solidity, cracked
and shrunk (as we see clay does in the open air) and so left casual
fissures every where: the water then by degrees found or made an outlet
from many meeting together; and this created fountains, most commonly
toward the bottom of hills. This reasoning is strengthened by springs
running in less quantity in summer than winter, because the sun exhales
the dew and moisture, not suffering it so freely to sink down into the
earth.

Escaped from this Stygian cave, I revisited the antiquity called the
Round Fold, by the road side from Chelmerton hither, at Stadon; and
under the hill called Stadon Hoe. I take it to be a curious Celtic
antiquity, much of the nature of those which in Anglesey and Wiltshire
we call Druids houses: so in Dorsetshire circles of stones they call
Folds. The country people say it was cast up in war-time long since.
It consists of a square _vallum_, 100 feet each side: the ditch whence
it came is on the inside: eastward from this is a circle of 160 feet
diameter, of like manner: the whole stands on an open plain, which
declines northward: the square is upon a level; but the circular part
declines gently from thence: on that point of the circle farthest from
the square is a little semicircular cove of earth, like the place of a
tabernacle. It is hard to say whether it was for a private use, or for
judicature, or religious affairs; but in the pasture behind it is a
barrow, and several more barrows in view, on the hill-tops. At Stadon
I saw a large square intrenchment, now divided into pastures; and upon
the top of the hoe, where the hawthorn stands, seem to have been some
works. This circle of ours, by sinking the ditch within, seems well
contrived for shows: five or six tire of people may stand commodiously
round it, and look over one another’s heads. Both _vallum_ and ditch
are but small, much inferior to that of a camp.

In the field by the garden at Buxton are two springs close together,
one hot, the other cold. Little flint arrow-heads of the ancient
Britons, called Elfs arrows, are frequently ploughed up here. Roman
plaster found here, mentioned in Thoresby’s _Ducat. Leodiens._ p. 558.
A Roman road is said to go hence to Burgh, beyond Elden park.

                   *       *       *       *       *

Journeying hence over the remainder of these Alpine regions, we come to
Goyt house, in the very centre of desolation. The most western of these
hills are more barren and difficult than the others, and fuller of
springs. At length we entered the pleasant country of Cheshire, as into
a new world; wondering that people are found who can content themselves
with the poverty and horror of the Peak, so near riches and delight.


                             MACCLESFIELD

Is a pretty large and pleasant town, sheltering itself from eastern
blasts by its vicinity to these high hills: it stands upon an eminence,
and is famous for manufactures of silk twisting, mohair, making
buttons, &c. The church is placed upon the edge of the hill. South is
a large chapel of the ancient family of Rivers (_Ripariis_) another
of the Leighs, where, for saying a small number of _Ave-marys_ and
_Paternosters_, we obtain 26,000 years and odd days of pardon: to such
a degree of extravagance was the superstitious folly of our ancestors
advanced!

Stockport is built on a hill of rock. The church is spacious. A place
called the Castle-yard, walled in. The Tame, Mersey, and other rivers,
meet here, falling from the Derbyshire hills: united they pass swiftly
through a rocky channel under a bridge of a single arch, large and well
turned: they cut themselves houses in the rock here, as at Nottingham.
Sometimes the floods reach the top of the bridge.


                              MANCVNIVM.

The Roman _castrum_ was on the west side of the Roman road going from
Chester, by Stretford, and on the northern bank of the river Medloc.
It is a small piece of level ground, somewhat higher than that around
it: it does not cover the whole piece, but is a square, 500 foot one
way, 400 the other: nor can it well be said to be ditched about; but
the ground near it, for some distance, is manifestly removed into the
castle, and spread along its verge, not as a regular _vallum_, but
sloping inward: by this means the _area_ of it is higher on the sides
than middle, and the external ground is lowered all around, to the
foot of the castle, which is steep like the side of a _vallum_. Upon
this edge there has been a wall quite round: the foundations of it
are to be discerned almost every where; in some places large parcels
of it left, but not above ground. Now they call it the Castle croft.
The river Medloc runs near it, but is no security to it, as being not
close enough: nor are its banks steep hereabouts, though its channel
is rock, as is the whole country near. This is a quarter of a mile
from the present town of Manchester. The Irwell river, coming through
the town, runs on the west side the castle, and there the Medloc
joins it. I look upon Manchester to be no ancient town; and even
the hundred is denominated from Saltford, the village on the other
side the bridge, therefore older: but Manchester is a much better
situation, as higher; placed too between two rivers, having rocky
and precipicious banks, with a good prospect: it is a very pleasant,
large, populous, and thriving town; new buildings added every day:
the roads are mending about it, and the river is making navigable;
which will still contribute to its prosperity. The old church is very
spacious and handsome, and enlarged still with numbers of large chapels
and oratories; but the monuments, which were many, are destroyed and
obliterated: a priest, of the name of Huntingdon, lies before the
altar. It is a collegiate church, and the stalls in the choir are of
very good carved work in the old manner.

This country is very woody, and affords a fine prospect every where,
bounded by high and distant hills. A conflux of the many roads at this
place gave origin to the town. Saltford is a large town; a broad and
very strait street leading to Warington, probably Roman: a very good
bridge over the river. Ten yards west from the castle is a natural
precipice, which the Romans disregarded, trusting to their walls, but
more to their own valour. A cavity cut in the rock by the river, under
the south-west angle. The natural track of this road is north-east, but
towards Manchester it trends a little more northward; I suppose, with
an intent to come to the bridge, where it met the road from _Veratinum_.

I saw the altar at Holm house, lady Bland’s: it is 16 Roman inches
broad, one front; a foot on the sides; 28 inches high: it is now
removed out of the garden into coverture. They call the castle the
Giant’s castle. Probably there was a town at the river Medloc in Roman
times: an annual fair is still kept there. The castle stands parallel
to the road. The river Irke comes in here under the college-walls: the
castle-walls were pulled up to mend and build the churches and bridges.

I find the Roman road went across the church-yard originally, and so by
the common street to the bridge over the Irke, called Scotland bridge:
then it ascends the hill, and proceeds with its original direction
north-east to Rochdale, which way the old _Coccium_ was. Edward the
elder by our monkish authors is said to have built a castle here, which
probably was by the church and college; and the church may be founded
on its ruins: this drew the town that way: the meeting of the two
rivers there, and the steep rocks upon them, rendered it a convenient
situation for such a work.

The college founded by Chetham, a tradesman, has a very good library,
and good salary: here are about fifty boys maintained.

Mr. Prescot of Chester has a gold Otho found here. I saw a Celt found
in the mosses.


                               CONDATE.

We rode all the way upon the Roman road from Manchester to this place:
it is the common road throughout, except a little near Altringham:
that market-town has caused it to be left, by a common; but we recover
it again at Bowden hill, whence we had the prospect of it a long way
before us, in a strait line: it leaves Altringham a little to the
east, passes west of Rotherston mere, close on the west of North
Tabley house, and so directly to Northwich, which therefore must be of
necessity the _Condate_ of Antoninus. The Britons called these wiches,
or places of salt-works, _Hellath_, from _heli_, salsugo: the last
syllable seems to be in _Condate_: then it will signify the principal
salt-work, _cond_, caput. Part of the road hither, by the Bollin river,
they call Wash-way, from its wateriness; which shows the derivation of
our country washes. This town stands in an angle made by the Weaver
river and the Dane, both which are passed by bridges, sometimes
overflow with great fury. South of the bridge, upon the high ground by
the Chester road, is a great _tumulus_, or keep, of Saxon work, called
the Castle. This is a pretty large town, but meanly built, depending
intirely upon the salt trade: here are the strongest springs of brine,
and the wonderful mines or rocks of salt, 60 yards under ground, which
they work like coal-mines: how far they extend, is not known. I doubt
not but there are many more all over this country: these are found out
by chance, not many years since: they carry it into Ireland, Wales,
and other places; and boil it up afresh with seawater. It is a most
liberal gift of Nature, a compendious way of making salt; these springs
being stronger than the ocean: the rock salt stronger than they; for
it is perfect salt, transparent like crystal: it lies not in veins, or
_strata_, as other minerals, or metals; but a solid rock, of unknown
dimensions, which they hew away with steeled pick-axes, leaving pillars
and spaces, as big as a cathedral. Poplar-trees are plentiful in this
country: they all lean eastward, as continually pressed by the west
winds from the sea.

The country from Northwich to Chester is intirely sand, and very
deep: a barren view; once a forest. They dig up the turf every where
for fewel; which prevents for ever its being capable of cultivation,
otherwise not impracticable: the oaks are all gone. Mid-way is the
Chamber in the forest, as called, upon a very high hill of sandy stone.
Here they say Edelfleda, the great Mercian princess, built a city;
I rather believe, a fortress, and that probably one of the Romans
originally, to guard this road. We can scarce affirm any thing of the
Roman way is visible, except at first setting out from Northwich, and
near Chester, where it falls into the original Watling-street, half
a mile off the city, by the river side: but there can be no manner
of doubt but that a Roman way was drawn here, to that we rode on
before: how it was done by that people, I cannot guess; for it was
impracticable to raise a bank; and it would be wholly vain in this
sand, unless they dug it away to the bottom, which is impossible: I
suppose it was by stones set on both sides at proper distances, for a
direction only, which are since carried away, or buried by the sands;
for now and then we saw a stone seeming to be milliary. There is a
horse-race, with a very good course; which shows the turf is well
consolidated, where not skimmed off for the purposes aforesaid. When we
draw near to Chester, we see on the left the Welsh mountains: on one,
which is a very steep precipice on all sides, stands Beeston castle:
before us, they rise one above another, and leave the clouds below
their summits. Mr. Gale gives us several instances of _Condate_, and
the like words, signifying a place where is the union of some rivers:
and such is the situation of Northwich, where the Dane and the Weaver
meet at the town; and the Pever a little below it, by the salt-rock. At
Tarvin, where the road passes over a river approaching to Chester, is
Stanford, so called from it.

This is a noble old city, the work of the victorious 20th Legion, the
conquerors of these western regions. It is manifest at first sight,
that they regarded, in the plan of it, the known form of their camps:
it is a parallelogram set to the four quarters of the heavens; the
longest side north and south: suburbs are extended eastward, and a new
gate called the bars, where the Watling-street, and the road from
Condate, enters: the Roman walls take in exactly the space of 10,000
foot, or two miles. The soil is sandy, upon rock of a red colour and
sandy composure, with small pebbles intermixed. The soil has been more
or less sandy ever since we left the Chiltern hills at Dunstable.

Riding under the gate where the Watling-street enters, I observed
immediately two arches of Roman work. I was overjoyed at sight of so
noble an antiquity, which has never been mentioned. It was a square of
twenty foot within; for so far are they distant from each other, and
of so much diameter: they are exactly of the same manner as those at
Lincoln; the stones not quite so large, nor so good: the breadth is
2½ foot. On each side was a portal, of a lesser arch, and lower, for
foot-passengers; for part of the arch is left, and people now alive
remember them open quite through; though now both these, and part of
the great arch, are taken up by little paltry shops: or, rather, the
lesser ones are quite pulled down, and even the great ones are in
the utmost danger of falling; for the occupants of those places cut
away part of the bottom of the semicircle to enlarge their shops. The
portals answered to the Rows (as they call them) so remarkable in
this city, being portico’s quite through on both sides the streets,
undoubtedly continued in a manner from the Roman times. It is admirable
that these vast arches, made of stones of so large dimensions, and
laid without mortar, can stand at all when their proper butment is
destroyed: that which regards the city has a key-stone: in both, below
the lowest stone of the arch, the two next courses downward project a
little inward, in nature of imposts; and over the crown of the arches
runs a course of projecting stones moulded a little, but coarsely:
the stones are artfully, though rudely cut; to which it is owing that
they are not fallen, as depending wholly on their own principles, and
the manner of their masonry, or geometry. Here terminates the famous
Watling-street, whose beginning in Dover valley I walked over in May
last. The road is here preserved, going by the river side to Aldford.

The ancient subterraneous canals are perfect still; their outlets into
the river under the city-walls are visible; and they say that they
are so high, that a man may walk upright their whole length. Wherever
they dig, they find subterraneous vaults and arches, and all manner
of antiquities; many of which were collected by the late Mr. Prescot,
prebend of the cathedral here, and now remain in the hands of his son.

The city is commodiously placed in an angle of the river, which washes
and protects two sides of it. As I said, it is an oblong square, 600
paces one way, 400 the other; that is, 3000 feet by 2000. Two principal
streets run its length at equal distances from the walls and each
other: one may be called _Principium_, having the gates at each end;
the other is _Quintana_: they are crossed in the middle by the _via
prætoria_, where are the gates _Decumana_ and _Prætoria_. Another
principal street runs on each side it, equidistant from it, and the
walls of the ends: these may be called _strigæ_. Other lesser streets,
or _hemistrigæ_, subdivide some of the squares made by the principals.
Thus must the original scheme be understood, when the military and
civil citizens first founded and inhabited the place. The little
difference now is caused by the cathedral and the castle: the castle,
the seat of Hugh Lupus, count palatine, and his successors, is built,
for the most part, beyond the limits of the Roman walls, in that angle
next the flexure of the river; consisting of a great court, and keep,
strongly walled, and fenced with a ditch: the city-wall carried still
round without it. To the north of the castle is some small remnant of
a nunnery. The meadow between the walls and the river here is called
Rood-eye, from a cross there, the stump whereof remains: upon this
they keep a horse-race. The city-walls are carefully repaired by the
corporation, and make an agreeable walk quite round: they are founded
intirely on the rock. The churches have every where, as in other
places, deformed the streets, which are originally the most noble and
spacious I have seen. The whole city has a descent every way from
the centre. The castle is rendered strong as the nature of the place
will allow of: here the earls called their courts of parliament, and
administered all affairs of state and judicature with regality.

Last year, digging in the chapter-house, they found the bodies of some
of the old earls palatine, wrapped up in leather sewed; but within
that, they were laid in woolen, like what we call wadding: the bones
are pretty perfect, but the flesh is gone. They showed us one, thought
to be Randulf Demeschin, the last earl, laid in a stone coffin; a place
left for his head: he lies on the right hand of Hugh Lupus, the first
earl.

They have built a large handsome exchange over-against the front of the
cathedral, with pillars of one stone. The city is not set precisely
east and west, though pretty near it. The ancient Roman gate at the
Watling-street was larger than the rest, because of the entrance of
the Roman ways there from _Condate_, _Bonium_, and the greatest part
of the kingdom; likewise for readier passage of the soldiers upon
occasion, most requisite that way; two of the other gates being fenced
by the river: therefore this extends in front to 80 foot. This city in
Roman times must have appeared admirably beautiful, with such spacious
streets: the tradesmens shops and houses I suppose then to have been
next the piazza’s of the streets; the soldiers tenements backwards,
with gardens into the squares, as it is at present. The river, which
once washed the city-walls, is now thrown off to some considerable
distance by salt-marshes: a dam too is made across it by the bridge,
for the sake of the mill; and by other mismanagements it grows worse
every day, so that ships cannot come up near the place; whence the only
little trade they have accruing from the passage into Ireland, is in
danger.

[Sidenote: TAB. LXVI.]

I saw at Mr. Prescot’s the Roman altar of Flavius Longus: it is very
intire, and very prettily ornamented. On the top where the _discus_
usually is, is cut the head of a Genius within a garland: on one side
is a Genius with a _cornucopia_; on the other, a flower-pot with leaves
of brank-ursin. It was found under a house by east-gate. He has more
fragments of antiquity; Roman bricks, square for paving, a foot each
side ; some marked LEG. XX. V. two inches and an eighth high; some
hollow bricks with a double cavity for hypocausts. He has likewise a
curious statue of the god Mithras with the Phrygian bonnet, and a torch
in his hands, standing cross-legged: it was found under a niche of the
wall, between east-gate and the river. Some of the bricks are thus
marked, LEG. XX. V. V. which demonstrates they mean the _legio vicesima
valeria victrix_. The altar has a square pedestal of one stone, which
it stood on: the back of the altar is carved with drapery, and a
festoon. Along with it was found a little earthen pot like a lamp; a
brass winged Genius, small; two brass _fibula_’s; all in Mr. Prescot’s
possession: he has likewise a brass camp-kettle, with two rings, 21
Roman inches high, found near here. The other inscription, which
his father had, of PRAESENGVNTA, is sent to Oxford. He has also
a very large collection of coins, brass, silver, and gold, most found
at Chester. A golden British bracelet weighing 19 guineas, found lately
in Wales, was melted down by a goldsmith here.

[Sidenote: TAB. LXVII.]

Walking beyond the river, I found the Roman way going to _Bonium_:
it answers precisely to the great street of the city, which I call
_principia_, and is extremely strait: it goes through Eccleston,
Easton, &c. Examining where it passed down by the bridge on the west
side, I was led to visit a rock hard by, over-against the castle:
there I discovered a Roman carving of a goddess, in a tabernacle, with
an altar: it was not in the least difficult to see the traces of a
Roman hand, through so many years, rubbing of cattle, and ill usage.
There is a seat hollowed out close by it, and which has taken away
part of a pillar, supporting the pediment. It is a figure of Pallas,
with a shield on her left arm: a belt from her left shoulder holds a
sword tied under her right arm, after the Roman mode: she has a spear
supporting her right hand: her under garments reach down to her feet.
The altar stands against one of the pillars, and has a little hole at
top of it. I wonder it has escaped ruin so long, placed so near a great
city, and so low that it is subject to all manner of injuries.

This city is of a most charming situation; the prospect around it
every way is august. The walls were repaired by queen Edelfleda. They
talk of king Egbert’s palace by St. John’s. Between Eastgate and the
river the Roman wall is pretty perfect for 100 yards together, made of
squarish-cut stones, the length inwards, with little mortar appearing
on the outside: I suppose they run it in along the inside liquid.
This was an admirable contrivance for strength: as the wall of the
gate was but one stone in thickness throughout; so by this means the
city-wall consisted of few stones in thickness. Mr. Prescot showed us
some urns, great and small, many fragments of _patera_’s of fine red
earth, found here; some with embossed work of flowers, animals, &c.
some with the potters’ marks at the bottom, particularly MACRINV
and CARAIED OFF. likewise many horns of little deer and other
animals found by the altar.

The village beyond the bridge is called Henbury, denoting its
antiquity. Many fragments, seemingly of pillars and capitals, set
for sitting-stones before the doors about the city, particularly in
Parson’s lane.

To the east of the cloisters is the building called the Chapter-house,
from the use it was put to; but I suppose it a _mausolæum_ of the earls
of Chester: it is on the north side of the choir; it is of an odd and
ancient kind of building: there is a _vestibulum_ to it, of a very
pretty model, which I have not seen elsewhere: the pillars are cabled,
without capitals, so that they resemble palm-trees. In the gateway
between this and the _mausolæum_ they showed us a coffin of stone,
or rather vault, of the length of a man, and proper depth (about six
foot): at the head was cut a cross; in the bottom lay the skeleton;
probably the first abbot made by the earls: they guess that to be Hugh
Lupus’s remains, which are buried in the very middle of the place.
There were found seven of these graves, correspondent to the number of
earls. Bishop Ripley, who built the body of the church, lies under a
brass in St. Mary’s chapel: behind the clock is a painting of him, with
Christ, St. Peter, and other figures, and much writing in Latin verse,
but defaced. St. Werburg’s shrine, foundress of the cathedral, was an
elegant structure of stone carved: little niches with gilt statues of
saints, men and women of the Saxon nobles, their names wrote upon
each, some still legible, all defaced, their heads broke off, &c. the
bishop’s throne is built upon it. There has been an ancient monastery
at St. John’s, much ruins of which remain. The cloysters have been
built since the _mausolæum_. They have a report that king Edgar’s
palace was upon that rock, by the river side, where the image of
Pallas is cut; but I think erroneously: it seems to have been a Roman
_villa_ and gardens of some learned commander. There are but two chief
streets of the city wanting, as plotted by the founders; on one stands
the cathedral: that answering it, on the opposite side of the city,
at present is but a foot-path, and lane across gardens, which have
encroached upon it on both sides. There are some Roman bricks in the
wall of the Friery, as observed by Mr. Gale. In one quadrangle by the
cloysters is a wall with Gothic arches, very much pointed, like that
at Peterburgh, engraven by Mr. Sparkes, V. p. 130. Edesburg was the
name of the Chamber in the Forest. At the great house over-against the
shambles is a hypocaust of the Romans, made of bricks all marked with
the twentieth legion. It is now the floor of the cellar.


                              LEVERPOOL.

Leaving this famous seat, and the antique monuments of the renowned
twentieth legion, we directed our course northward through the
Chersonese, between the mouths of the Dee and the Mersey; a flat,
sandy, clayey country, not much unlike the best part of the
Lincolnshire levels. To the east of the old church of Bevington is
added a spacious choir, and side-ailes. We ferried over the great bay
to Leverpool. In the visto upward, the huge mountain whereon stands
Beeston castle is very entertaining: it appears, though at the distance
of above twenty miles, as a great rock emerging from the water. The
novelty of Leverpool forbad us to hope for antiquities: it is a
large, populous, busy town, placed upon the edge of the water, in a
sandy soil, and open country, arisen from the commodiousness of its
situation, with a spacious harbour. Quarry hill, a delf of stone of
the red sort, and sandy, but not a brown red; so that in building it
has a pleasant colour; and that fetched deep is lasting, and a good
sort of stone: the new church is built of it; a neat building, by a
good architect. I observed in this quarry, that the workmen make for
themselves artificial springs at pleasure; for, though the _strata_
here are very close together, and of a considerable breadth, yet there
is a small dripping between some of them, especially those not far from
the ground: here they cut a little bason, which is never empty. This
confirms my former sentiments about springs.

Near the new church is a most magnificent charity-school. Here was a
great castle, or tower, which they are pulling down; and a new church
is building upon its ruins. The wet dock is a most capacious bason,
with a broad street round it: the custom-house, a very neat building,
fronts the dock. This town seems to be as big as Manchester; and they
are building new streets every where. The process of the delf ware made
here is very curious. There is a scarcity of good water here. From this
place I first beheld the Irish sea.

We paid a visit to lord Derby at his seat at Knowsley, who may be
truly said to be a person _antiquæ fidei_, grown old in wisdom: he has
left the vanities of courts and cities for a retirement, which his
lordship diversifies and makes still more agreeable with the greatest
judgement. This is one of his seats: it stands on very high ground
with a delicate prospect, and abounds with canals and fish-ponds: it
has a park ten miles in circumference. The whole is newly refitted and
adorned by my lord, and rendered very delightful. There is a great
range of new building, with fine apartments full of admirable pictures,
of antique marbles, and good furniture. The pictures are by the most
celebrated masters, as M. Angelo, Caravagio, Veronese, Luca Jordano;
a fine stag-hunting by Snyders, engraved by Sympson; sea-pieces by
Vandeveld: many of Vandyke, Rubens, (one painted on paper, as Dr.
Mead’s) and the story of Ulysses and Achilles; the Triumph of Industry,
the original sketch of which I have: many of Salvator Rosa, and two
great drawings of his upon boards; Titian, Carlo Maratti, and an
infinity more. The bustoes are, young Geta; a coloss one of Faustina;
a lesser one of the same, with one breast naked, very beautiful;
Caligula; Gallienus; Alba Terentia, Otho’s mother; one that seems to
be Pompey when young, or one of his sons: a brass head, said to be
Michael Angelo; a lesser bust of Flora; a fine bust of Homer in Parian
marble, of curious Greek work; another, a philosopher, of like work
and materials; with several more. A statue of Hercules, two foot and a
half high; two fine statues of Venus rising from the sea, somewhat less
than life; a little statue of a Faunus; one of Bacchus; a lesser one of
Ceres; another Venus with a dolphin, and a Mercury, both less than life.

Among the portraits, that of the famous countess of Richmond and
Derby, foundress of St. John’s and Christ’s colleges in Cambridge; a
full-length picture of a man born near here, called the Child of Hale,
11 foot high.

My lord has in his library a great collection of drawings, particularly
the whole collection of the late Cheron, after Raphael; one of Hans
Holbein, Henry VII. Henry VIII. &c. the original of the painting at
Whitehall.

Near Knowsley are coal-pits. From the summer-house on the top of the
hill in the park may be seen six counties in England, three in Wales;
the Wrekin. The tower at Liverpool, by the water-side, was built by Sir
John Stanley, ancestor to my lord.

West-Derby, near here, is the place whence the title of the earldom.
The trees here universally bend very much to the east, owing to the
continual breezes from the Irish sea. This country is observed to have
much rain all the year round, owing to the same cause; and were it not
so, it would be very barren, as confiding wholly of sand upon solid
rock, as all this western country is.

Ormskirk is said to be named from a church built by one Orme in
former times: one of his name, still left, is wrote upon the font as
churchwarden. This belongs to lord Derby; and here is the burial-place
of the family, a deep vault filled up to the very church-floor with
coffins: some old fragments of alabaster monuments of the family
of Stanley; others of the Scaresbricks. The church consists of two
buildings at different times; and two steeples, one a spire, the other
a large square tower; and both are crowded together in an unseemly
manner.

From thence we travelled toward Preston, over a boggy, flat and black
level, called a Moss. On the right, at a distance, we saw Houghton
castle upon a high hill; before us, the vast Lancashire mountains, on
the tops of which the clouds hung like fleeces; till we forded the
famous _Belisama_, now the Ribel; I suppose, _Rhe bel_, the river Bel.
Vide Selden _de diis Syris_.


                             RIBLECHESTER.

I went to view this old station: it is prettily seated on a rising
knoll upon the river; at some distance all round inclosed with higher
ground, well clothed with wood and hedge-rows: beyond which the barren
mountains, or Fells, as they generally call them here, from the Cimbric
_fala_. The soil hereabouts is gravel with clay and sand by spots. The
river Rible is very broad at this place, rapid and sonorous, running
over the pebbles, and, what is much to be lamented, over innumerable
Roman antiquities; for in this long tract of time it has eaten away a
third part of the city. I traced out the old ground-plot, and where
the wall and ditch went round it: it lay in length east and west along
the north side of the river, upon its brink, 800 foot long, 500 broad:
originally, I apprehend, two streets ran along its length, and three
crossed them on its breadth. This place has been long famous for old
monuments found therein; and some fragments still remaining I had a
sight of. At the door of the Red-lion ale-house I saw the base of a
pillar, and a most noble shaft, seven foot long, handsomely turned;
which was fished out of the river: it is undoubtedly Roman originally,
though the base has, I guess, been used as the stump of a later cross,
in which this country abounds: there is a _scotia_ and two torus’s at
the bottom, though not very elegantly formed; perhaps it was never
finished: the whole piece is 2½ foot high, 22 inches in diameter: the
_frustum_ of the column lay in the ale-house yard, where the weather,
and other accidents, have obliterated an inscription consisting of
three or four lines, towards the top: it is 17 inches diameter at top.
One corner of this house is a Roman partition-wall, built of pebbles
and hard mortar, as usual. This house now is by the brink of the river,
leaving only a scanty road between; but within memory a great many
houses opposite, and among them the chief inn of the town, were washed
away. Farther on, down the river, a great part of an orchard fell down
last year; and the apple-trees still grow in their own soil at bottom.
Viewing the breach of the bank exposed thereby, I saw the joists and
boards of a floor of oak, four foot under the present surface, with
many bits of Roman bricks, potsherds, and the like; and such floors
are to be seen along the whole bank, whence most antiquities are found
in the river. The late minister of this place, Mr. Ogden, collected
all the coins, intaglia’s, and other antiquities, found here in great
quantities; but his widow, as far as I could learn, disposed of them
to Mr. Prescot of Chester: I was shown the top of a great two-handled
_amphora_, or wine-jar, taken out of the river, of whitish clay: I saw
another like fragment; and among antiquities he took up a very large
piece of _corallium tubulatum_, bigger than a man’s head; an admirable
curiosity of nature. By symmetry I find the whole channel of the river,
at present, lies within the precincts of the old city: the original
channel on the other side being filled up with the city-walls, and
rubbish; for it bends with a great elbow toward the city. The eastern
limit of the city, or that upward of the river, lies against a brook
there falling in; and the two streams playing against that angle,
have carried it away, and still threaten them. At the western end of
the city, or down the stream, a whole road, and some houses too, by a
barn, are absorbed; and great quantity of ashler, the remains of the
wall, has been carried off for building: much remains in the ground,
and on the edge of the stream. Farther up the land, and all along the
west side of the church-wall, the ditch is perfect, and the rampire
where the wall stood pretty high, and the foundation of the wall a
little apparent. They tell me the ashler stone still lies its whole
length. They call this Anchor hill; and, when digging by the house
that stands upon part of it, they found anchors, and great quantities
of iron pins, of all sizes, for ships or barges; for they say this
river was navigable so high formerly, at least for smaller vessels.
The north-west angle of the city is manifest, and where the northern
wall turned round the north side of the church: a little way down a
lane at that angle, a great bank runs westward, made of stone, like a
Roman road. There is a lane goes down, north of the city, to the brook,
called the Strand; which confirms their having some sort of navigation
here. At the end of this lane is the street which is the Roman road,
running directly northward up the fell, called Green gate: it passes
over Langridge, a great mountain so named from it, so through Bowland
forest: it appears green to the eye. In this street, over-against the
Strand, is an old white house, where they say Oliver Cromwell lay,
when going to Preston in pursuit of the Scots, after the battle of
Marston-moor. The eastern wall over the brook stood likewise on a sort
of precipice. I saw a large coin of Domitian, of yellow brass, very
fair, found in the river, _Imp. cæs. domit. aug. germ. cos._ xvi.
_cens. per pp._ reverse, Jupiter sitting in a curule chair, the _hasta
pura_ in his left, an eagle on his right hand, _Jovi victori_; exergue
S. C. another pedestal of a pillar found in the river. Just under the
Red-lion a subterraneous canal comes into the river, so high that one
may walk upright in it, paved at the bottom. Many urns have been found
hereabouts, but all lost and disregarded since Mr. Ogden died, who
collected such things. They know the track of the Roman road all the
way over the hills. In a garden by the Unicorn’s head a gold finger was
found, and another brass finger as large as a man’s; two intaglia’s of
Mercury with wings on his feet, the _caduceus_, &c. found near Anchor
hill: much ashes and bones found about the city. Up the river, eight
miles off, is Pendle hill, a vast black mountain, which is the morning
weather-glass of the country people: upon it grows the cloud-berry
plant. Digging in the church-yard, silver coins have been frequently
turned up. The river hither is open and deep; but at Salesbury, a
mile higher, rocks begin: therefore it is likely this place was
chosen by the Romans because at the extent of navigation. Half of one
longitudinal street, and of two latitudinals, are consumed. Horses and
carriages frequently fall down the steep from the street, because it is
narrow, and but factitious ground.

Panstones, up the hill, by the Green-moor lane, or Roman road, is a
place much talked of; but they know not for what. I suppose it is
either some Roman building, or a road eastward, or some _terminus_.
They told me of an altar thereabouts with an inscription, axes, and the
like, carved on it: it is on Duttonley, by Panstones. Haughton tower is
within view; a great castle upon a precipicious hill.

Many are the inscriptions found here from time to time: Dr. Leigh has
seen them all. Now they are removed, lost, or spoiled: one great altar
they told me was carried to Dunkin hall, the seat of lady Petre, with
an inscription, a ram, and a knife; many taken away by the family of
Warrens, living lately at Salesbury hall. I saw the fragment of a
stone, in the corner of a house by the mill, cut with very fair large
letters: under the next house is the _frustum_ of a pillar, 20 inches
diameter, made into a horse-block: I saw another flat stone at the
town’s end, laid over a gutter, with a monumental moulding upon it.

Above the town half a mile is a noble bridge of four very large arches,
built lately by the country: over this I went to Salesbury; but all the
inscriptions are carried away, probably to Mr. Warren’s other seat,
near Stockport in Cheshire. I found a large stone in the corner of
the house, which has been a Roman monumental stone, foolishly placed
there for the sake of the carving: there are three large figures upon
it, sweetly performed, and good drapery, though half worn way by time;
a man and woman holding hands, both half naked; somewhat roundish in
the woman’s hand: at the end is Apollo resting on his harp, his head
leaning on his hand, as melancholy for the loss of a votary; for such
we may guess the deceased, either a poet, physician, or musician:
probably there was more carving on those sides within the wall. This
has been a very large seat, with a park. They told me there were some
carved stones at Dinkley, another seat of Mr. Warren’s, a mile farther;
but I found they were all carried elsewhere, save two altars, both
obliterated, but well cut: one stood in a grass-plot in the garden,
covered over with moss and weeds; another used in the house as a
cheese-press. This is a romantic place, hanging over the river purling
across the rocky falls, and covered with wood. The late Mr. Warren was
very careful of these learned remnants. They told me that Ribchester
was destroyed by the Scots. These are all the memoirs I could pick
up in about five hours I staid there, _& antiquum tenuerunt flumina
nomen_. Ovid. Met.

Dr. Leigh, in _Lancaster_, says a Roman way goes from Manchester to
Ribchester by strange ways towards Bury: he gives a cut of a ruby found
here; on it a soldier with spear and shield. I take the two altars I
saw at Salesbury to be those described in Dr. Leigh’s _Lancaster_.

At Langho, Ardulf king of Northumberland gained a victory, anno 798.


                              LANCASTER.

Between Preston and this place we had the vast hills that part
Yorkshire and Lancashire, all the way on our right. This is all sandy
country to within three miles of Lancaster; then rock begins: the other
has rock under it, but red and sandy; this is white. Where the castle
and church stand is a high and steep hill, length east and west: this
was the Roman _castrum_. I found a great piece of the wall at the
north-east, in the garden of Clement Townsend; and so to Mr. Harrison’s
summer-house, which stands upon it: it is made of the white stone of
the country, and very hard mortar, and still very thick, though the
facing on both sides is peeled off for the sake of the squared stone,
which they used in building. A year or two ago a great parcel of it was
destroyed with much labour. This reached quite to the bridge-lane, and
hung over the street at the head of the precipice in a dreadful manner:
from the summer-house it went round the verge of the close north of
the church, and took in the whole circuit of the hill. The ditch on
the outside of it is now to be seen. I suppose it originally inclosed
the whole top of the hill where the church and castle stand, which is
steep on all sides, and half inclosed by the river Lune; so that it was
an excellent guard to this part of the sea-coast, and commands a very
great prospect both by sea and land. Here was this great convenience
too in the situation, that on the south side of the castle walls, under
the tower, is a spring. All the space of ground north of the church
is full of foundations of stone buildings, Roman, I believe; and much
stone has been taken up there. To the west of the church is part of
a partition wall left, of that time. This is a navigable river. The
castle built since on this spot has been very strong; it suffered in
the civil wars. The prospect hence takes in all the western sea, and
sometimes reaches the isle of Man. The Cumberland and Westmorland hills
are of such a nature as I never saw before: I took them for clouds at
first, not only from their height, but figure; consisting not of long
ridges, but pens, or sugar-loaves, suddenly breaking off. Eastward is
Ingleborough, a very strange hill, having a flat place at top, like a
table: they say there are some works upon it, and some stones placed
like a bower: Camden takes notice of it as rising gradually eastward.
Upon some of these hills it was that George Fox ascended to converse
with the Holy Ghost, as he pretended; which he revealed to Nailor, and
so began the sect of the Quakers, about sixty years ago.

There is a friery in the town, and the church of it was standing within
memory. When they pulled down the Roman wall, they found many great
toads alive in the thickness of it, and where in all appearance there
could be no passage for them from without. The town of Lancaster lies
upon the eastern declivity, before the castle.


                      CONCANGIOS. +Water-crook.+

Through a very hard road, but not an unpleasant country, we entered
Westmorland. The river Can is very rapid, and full of cataracts, as
running chiefly over the rock, and having a great descent. It is
strange that the salmon coming up these rivers from the sea to lay
their spawn, when obstructed by these places, leap over them with a
surprizing force; and there they lie in wait to catch them with nets
laid on the upper edge. A mile below Kendal this river takes a circling
course, and makes a sort of peninsula, called Water-crook, where I
found the old city: its name signifies the valley upon the water Can.
It is a fine large valley, and very pleasant. Either with a cut, or
by nature, the river ran quite round the city. Mr. Tho. Guy is the
possessor of it. As soon as I came into the yard, I saw a large altar
placed by some steps: I believe it dedicate to Bacchus, because of
grapes and festoons on it: it is above three foot high: the festoons
are on three sides; the back is plain. All the house and out-houses
are built of Roman stone, dug up in the old city. The top of an altar
is put into a corner of that stable where the altar stands. At the end
of the house is a large statue or bas relief of Cupid: the gavel end
fell down some time ago, and knocked off his head and arms; but it is
well cut. In the garden, at the end of an out-house, is a very long
inscription on a stone. He showed me a little portable altar, but 7¼
Roman inches high: the dedicatory inscription is obliterated by using
it as a whet-stone; but it is prettily adorned, has two scrolls and the
_discus_ at top. Innumerable antiquities have been found here; great
arches and ruins of buildings: they never plough but somewhat is found.
The father of Mr. Guy saved many, which are since lost: this gentleman
found many brass, silver, and gold coins here; but all are dispersed,
except a large brass Faustina: he showed me an intaglia of Mercury set
in gold for a ring: another with three faces to a head; the foremost,
Mars with a helmet on; a woman’s face on each side: a paste of a light
onyx colour, with a head: a sepulchral lamp. He told me of a large
brass urn with bones in it found here: it had two ears to it, and was
used forty years ago, in the family, as a kettle, and is now at his
sister’s, Mrs. Herring, at Wall near Hexam.

The town of Kendal is very large, lying under a great hill to the
west; the river to the east. Upon the rise of the hill is a place
called Castle-low hill, which has been a castle raised in Saxon
times, fortified with a ditch where not naturally steep, and a keep
or artificial mount; a sorry way of encampment: the keep is narrow at
top, and cannot contain above forty people: they are much too high to
offend an enemy, and have no ground to defend. Above this are great
scars, or mountains, of a hard kind of stone like porphyry, that will
yield to no tool: they break it up in small shivers, for building, by
the force of a heavy gaveloc and sledge-hammer. I saw several pretty
springs running out of little hollows of the rock, especially toward
the upper part; and most of the _strata_ thereabouts drip continually:
the workmen told me, that those cracks where the springs are go a great
length into the mountain; and that the _strata_ all round the hill lie
declining with the side of the hill; that some _strata_ are soft and
porous, which lets the water strain through them; whilst others by
their hardness stop it, and turn it all into the cracks and fissures;
that these springs run very sparingly in dry weather: this shows that
they are made only of the rain and dews falling upon the hill, and
collected into these channels, which being generally perpetual, and
in sufficient quantity one time with another, render the springs so.
There is a spring on the top of Penigent hill, the highest in these
parts. In this country vast stones like the grey weathers in Wiltshire,
lie upon the surface, and by the sides of the hills, which are no
part of the quarry, being of a different stone. On the other side
of the town eastward, and over the river, is Kendal castle; a large
stone building on a solitary _apex_, but not extraordinary high: it is
fenced with a wall and ditch: they report that queen Catharine Parr
was born here. This town has been built mostly with pent-houses and
galleries over them all along the streets, somewhat like Chester. The
carts or carriages of this country are small machines, with two wheels
each, made of three pieces of timber, fastened to a cross axle-tree,
which turns with the wheels: the cart is laid upon these wheels _pro
tempore_, kept from slipping off the axle-tree by two pins underneath:
they are drawn by one horse.[1] They say these carriages, of a light
burthen and with one horse, answer better in this stony country than
heavier, which are shook to pieces presently: hence Nature makes the
horses of this country small in bulk. Here is an anchorite’s house
with a very fine spring: near was a chapel of St. Mary, Abbot’s hall,
and some other ruins of religious places. The church is a handsome and
very large structure, consisting of five ailes: a good organ: several
ancient chapels in it, with the tombs of the founders; one of Roos. The
parishes of this country are generally of great extent, having several
chapels of ease. This was, I believe, the county-town before Appleby,
as rising immediately after the destruction of the Roman city. In the
church is a monument of a judge, who died at the Assizes here in queen
Elizabeth’s time.

The city of _Concangios_ is much better situate than Kendal in
several respects; because good land for a considerable way quite
round it, as far as the valley reaches: the river, which may well be
called _spumosus_, incompasses it like a horse-shoe: it is deeper,
broader, and smoother, here than any where else: it is indeed a place
incomparably well chosen for a small city: the ground is sufficiently
high, even in floods; but floods render it an island, for it is low
ground before the entrance, but not marshy. Across the entrance there
are plain marks of a ditch north of the house; and Mr. Guy told me
there was a wall all along, an apparent rampire on the inside of it;
that his father dug up vast quantities of stone there: he showed me a
place in the city, where a hypocaust was found, all arched with Roman
brick, and paved with square bricks; that they covered it up again
without demolishing it. I saw a brass Antoninus, found here; and a
stone, somewhat like the capital of a small pillar, hexangular. Beyond
the low ground which lies before the entrance of the city, is a Roman
_tumulus_. Upon a slope of high ground, and in a pasture behind it,
is another very large hill, partly natural, and partly artificial,
by cutting away the roots of it, and rendering it more steep, as
it appeared to me: there is an ash-tree planted on it: when it was
ploughed, they discovered stones with mortar on them. I conjecture
there was a building upon it; probably an outguard, or lodge, for the
soldiers that stood upon the watch: for here was placed the _numerus
vigilum_ in the _Notitia_; and this place takes in a larger view than
the city, as being higher. The city contains about 14 acres of ground,
or more: it consists of two closes, one of twelve acres, another of
four; but the fortified part took not in intirely the twelve acres:
the ditch goes along the partition-fence visibly enough; the remainder
was suburbs to the castle, which was 500 foot one way, 600 another.
The inscription I spoke of at the end of the barn has not yet been
described. Thus Mr. Gale read it.

_Publius Ælius Publii filius Sergio Basso Decurioni legionis vicesimæ
valeriæ Victricis vixit annos       et privatus libertis et herm miles
emeritus legionis sextæ victricis fecerunt. Si quis sepulchro alium
mortuum intulerit mulctam ferat fisco Dominorum nostrorum, &c._

A great woollen manufactory at Kendal, especially of such stuffs as
are proper for hangings. Winander meer, near here, is ten miles long,
remarkable for a fish called _char_, which they pot, and send all over
the kingdom. This country is exceedingly obnoxious to rain, and some of
the hill-tops on one side or other are perpetually covered with clouds:
I imagine the vast solidity of the stone that composed them attracts
the clouds big with water at some considerable distance, and then the
winds break and dash them into rain. This is another furtherance of
hills being supplied with fountains.

The city of _Concangios_ is placed on the highest plot of the
Chersonese: the four acres westward are more meadow-like, but far
from low. A great ridge of hills runs north and south-eastward of
this place, called Hag-fell, of a fine downy nature, and good riding
on the southern point of it. About a mile and half off the city was
the _castrum exploratorum_, or watch-tower: it is a mere tip of very
high ground, like a narrow tongue, and very steep, especially side
ways: it is called Castle-steed: it is sixty foot broad, 120 long: the
sides being thus steep needed no ditch; but on the south end are two
ditches, on the north three: I suppose it was walled about: it is of
the common cliff of the country; and in one place the ditch has been
cut through the rock. At the bottom of this hill is a large spring,
which immediately falls into a cavity of the earth again, and so I
suppose rises lower in another place. From hence is a fine prospect
to the mouths of the rivers Can and Lune, and all over this coast.
The Westmorland hills raise themselves into a new and more romantic
appearance than before, and the place well answered the purpose of an
espial.

About a mile north of Kendal is a cave in the rock near a wood, called
Hells-fell Nab, or the Fairy-hole: they talk of organs, pillars,
flitches of bacon, and the like matters here, as at Poole’s Hole in
Derbyshire.


                                 SHAP.

On the south side of the town of Shap, six miles south
of Penrith, we saw the beginning of a great Celtic avenue, on a green
common. This is just beyond the horrid and rocky fells, where a good
country begins. This avenue is seventy foot broad, composed of very
large stones, set at equal intervals: it seems to be closed at this
end, which is on an eminence, and near a long flattish barrow, with
stone works upon it: hence it proceeds northward to the town, which
intercepts the continuation of it, and was the occasion of its ruin;
for many of the stones are put under the foundations of houses and
walls, being pushed by machines they call a _betty_, or blown up
with gunpowder. Though its journey be northward, yet it makes a very
large curve, or arc of a circle, as those at Abury, and passes over
a brook too. A spring likewise arises in it, near the Greyhound inn.
By the brook is a little round _sacellum_, composed of twelve stones,
but lesser ones, set by one great stone belonging to the side of the
avenue: the interval of the stones is thirty-five foot, half the
breadth of the avenue: the stones, no doubt, did all stand upright,
because three or four still do; but they were not much higher then,
than now as fallen, because of their figure, which is thick and short:
they are very large, and prodigiously hard, being nothing else but a
_congeries_ of crystals of very large sizes, of a flakey nature. Houses
and fields lie across the track of this avenue, and some of the houses
lie in the inclosure: it ascends the hill, crosses the common road to
Penrith, and so goes into the corn-fields on the other side of the
way westward, where some stones are left standing; one particularly
remarkable, called Guggleby stone. The people say these were set up
by enchantment: and the better sort of folks, as absurdly affirm,
they are made by art. I doubt not but they are gathered somewhere off
the surface, among the fells, and that here was a great temple of the
old Britons, such as that at Abury, which it resembles very much, as
far as I can judge at present; for the rainy weather, which in this
country is almost perpetual, hindered me from making at this time a
thorough disquisition into it. The ground it runs over consists of
gentle risings and fallings, but in general declines toward the west:
it is here, and for a great way further north, east and west, a very
fine downy turf, and pleasant hills; or at least they seemed so after
the rugged and barren views and roads we had just passed: but the
country under this turf is a lime-stone, quite different from the
stones of the avenue. In our journey hither the country is far worse
than the peaks of Derbyshire, and nothing to entertain the eye but the
numerous and rare cataracts; whole rivers, and the whole continuance
of them, being nothing else; the water every where running among the
rocks with great violence and rapidity: even the springs burst out of
the ground, and rise into the air with a surprising push: therefore
the Britons erected this laborious work very conveniently, beyond that
uncultivated frontier, and in a country where they might range about
in their chariots at pleasure. I guess, by the crebrity and number of
the stones remaining, there must have been two hundred on a side: near
them in several places are remains of circles to be seen, of stones set
on end; but there are no quantity of barrows about the place, which I
wonder at. Though these stones are not of such a flat form as those at
Abury, nor so big as some there; yet they are very large, and as heavy
as any of those in the avenues there. The site of the place is pretty
much bounded eastward by the hill that way adjacent; but there is a
large prospect west ward, and the country descends that way to a great
distance. At a place called in the maps Stone-heaps, we saw a cairn or
barrow made of stones: all the tops of the fells, I am told, abound
with these crystallised stones.

At the conflux of the rivers Louther and Eimont there is a remarkable
curiosity, that illustrates the method of the religious solemnities
of the old Britons, as much as any I have seen. Upon the edge of the
Louther, where the bridge now passes it, is a delicate little plain,
of an oblong form, bounded on the other side by a natural declivity:
this is used to this day for a country rendezvous, either for sports
or military exercises, shooting with bows, &c. On this plain stands
the antiquity commonly called King Arthur’s Round Table, and supposed
to be used for tilts and tournaments: it is a circle inclosed with a
ditch, and that with a _vallum_. At first sight we may see that it was
intended for sports, but not on horseback, because much too little:
the _vallum_ on the outside lies sloping inward with a very gradual
declivity, on purpose for spectators to stand around it; and it would
hold at least 10,000 people. The outside of the _vallum_ is pretty
steep: it was high originally, as may be seen now in some parts; but
it is worn down, as being by the side of the common road; and the
inhabitants carry it away to mend the highways withal. There are two
entrances into the _area_, north and south, or nearly so: one end is
inclosed into a neighbouring pasture: the _area_ had a circle within,
somewhat higher in elevation than the other. The outer verge of the
_vallum_ is a circle of 300 foot: the composition of it is intirely
coggles and gravel, dug out of the ditch. Upon part of the plain are
marks of the tents of the Scots army, that accompanied King Charles II.
in his way to Worcester: they encamped here for some time, and drew a
small line across part of the southern circle: this was done within
memory.

Just 400 foot from the verge of the south entrance is another circle,
300 foot in diameter, made contrarywise to the former: the _vallum_
is small, and the ditch whence it was taken is outermost. Thus these
two circles and the interval make 1000 foot in length; and there is
just room enough without them, next the river and next the bank, for
a _circus_ or foot-race, according to the old manner of the Grecian,
which were always celebrated by the sides of rivers.

_Centum ego quadrijugos agitabo ad flumina currus_, &c. Virg. and
probably British chariots had here their courses. On the southern end
it is manifest they contrived it just to leave room enough for the
turn; and it required good skill to drive a chariot so as not to fall
there, or into the river. It must be understood, that the bridge at
present, and another of wood formerly a little below it, have impaired
the banks by the more southern circle. This is the most delightful
place that can be imagined for recreation: the rapid river Louther
runs all along the side of it; the Eimot joins it a little way off, in
view: beyond is a charming view of a vast wood, and of Brougham castle;
beyond that, the ancient Roman city, and the Roman road going along
under the high hill whereon is the beacon. But these are things later
in time than our antiquity.

Though upon first sight of the place I knew its purport, yet I was more
fully convinced thereof when I went to see Mayborough, as called, which
is a little higher up the hill, on an eminence higher than any near it,
and full west from this place, or _circus_: it is a vast concavity, of
the same diameter as the circles just mentioned, viz. 300 foot: it is
made with an artificial _vallum_ of loose stones, without any ditch,
carried with great labour from some other place, and here orderly piled
up, so as to make a rampart as high and as broad as that at Abury: in
some places the turf, with which it was covered originally, is peeled
off: it slopes inward with a gentle descent on account of spectators;
outwardly it is as steep as the nature of the materials would suffer,
and now covered over with great timber-trees: the entrance is wide, and
opens full east, and to the _circus_. Within this fine plain, which is
now ploughed up, have been two circles of huge stones; four remaining
of the inner circle till a year or two ago, that they were blown
to pieces with gunpowder: they were of a hard black kind of stone,
like that of the altar at Stonehenge: one now stands, ten foot high,
seventeen in circumference, of a good shapely kind; another lies along:
this inner circle was fifty foot in diameter. One stone, at least, of
the outer circle remains, by the edge of the corn; and some more lie at
the entrance within side, others without, and fragments all about. Just
by the entrance, along the road runs a spring, full eastward.

This I suppose to be a great British temple, where the country met
on solemn days to sacrifice. After the religious duties were over,
they went down to the _circus_ to celebrate their games: and I could
not but admire the fine genius of these people in chusing places for
their sports; for upon the verge of the acclivity, along the _circus_,
an infinite number of people might stand to see the whole without
the least inconvenience, besides those in the plain between the two
circles; and these two circles admirably well executed the intent of
the _meta_’s, but much better than those in the Roman _circus_’s. In
ploughing at Mayborough they dug up a brass Celt. On the other side of
the Eimot, upon a high ground overlooking all, is a very fine round
_tumulus_, of a large size, and set about with a circle of stones: this
in all probability was the funeral monument of the king that founded
the temple and _circus_. Somebody has lately been digging away part of
the barrow, and carried off some of the stones, and demolished others.

There is another Celtic monument in the fields beyond the Louther,
and south-east of Countess pillar, upon a fine dry spot of ground
near the moors: this is in sight of the temple. It consists of many
burial-places, marked out with stones set at equal distances. One
points eastward, and is what I take to be an arch-druid’s; being above
100 foot long, not a raised _tumulus_, but a pyramidal form designed
by two sides of stones like an avenue. A little way above the head of
this is another longish burial, and on a sort of barrow: it points
differently from the former. Farther on is the arc of a circle,
consisting of four large stones equidistant, opening south: I believe
this to be part of another: one of the stones is of the same nature
as those at Shap. Further on is one side of another long burial, like
the first. There are many more such-like hereabouts, but ruinous; for
the stones are carried away for building the adjacent moor-houses and
walls. In the pasture on the eastern bank of the Louther, in the way to
Clifton, are several cairns, or carracks, as the Scotch call them, made
of dry stones heaped together; also many other monuments of stones,
three, four, five, set upright together. They are generally by the
country people said to be done by Michael Scot, a noted conjuror in
their opinion, who was a monk of Holm abbey in Cumberland: they have
a notion too that one Turquin, a giant, lived at Brougham castle; and
there is a tower there, called Pagan tower; and Sir Lancelot de Lake
lived at Mayborough, and slew him. Near Clifton is a famous spring,
where the people go annually on May-day to drink, by a custom beyond
all remembrance: they hold it an earnest of good luck the ensuing year,
to be there and drink of the water before sun-rise. This, no doubt, has
been continued from the British times, and is a remain of the great
quarterly festival of the vernal equinox. So at Sidbury, on Palm Sunday.

Old Penrith is _Petrianis_, on the river Peterel: it signifies the
warth over the river Petria; so that _Penrith_, its successor, is but a
corruption of _Petterith_.


                                GALAVA.

The Roman city lies on the east side of the Louther, just by Brougham
castle, whose walls, and those of the park, are for part built of
the stones from the old city, being manifestly of a Roman cut. The
trace of the place is very easily discovered, where the ditch went
between the Roman road and the river. I saw many fragments of altars
and inscriptions at the hall nearer the bridge, all exposed, in the
court-yard, to weather, and injuries of every sort. In the wall by the
Roman road beyond Brougham castle, and near the countess of Pembroke’s
pillar, is a pretty busto, part of a funeral monument; the _bulla_ of
the mantle most conspicuous, though much injured. Farther on, in the
same dry wall, nearer the corner, is another _basso relievo_, but so
defaced, that I could not make any thing of it. The Roman road coming
from Carlisle, very apparent as they tell me, passes above or north of
the town of Penrith, under the beacon-hill; then passes the river just
under the castle; then went by the south side of the city, where its
pavement is now firm and good; then where Countess pillar now stands:
here it is visible as far as the horizon in a very strait lane, going
full east to Appleby. Vast quantities of Roman stone, taken up in the
city, have been burnt into lime. Coins, Mosaic floors, and every sort
of antiquity, are daily found: they cannot strike a stroke into the
ground but inscriptions, pillars, and some sort or other of ancient
remains, appear. The site of the city is an elevated piece of ground
by the river side; a woody country about it: a vast hill, or fell, of
an immense height, goes all along the partition of this county from
Durham, in sight here; and by the side of it, three remarkable lesser
hills, or pikes, as they call them deservedly; being extremely sharp
and conical, and very regularly so.

On the corner of Clifton house is an inscription with carving on it:
it is an admirable fine stone, or rather two joined together in the
middle; placed at the very top of a gable end: two winged Victories,
with garlands and palm-branches in their hands, stand on their sides.

I saw at Lowther, the seat of lord Lonsdale, an ugly brass figure with
wings, and somewhat like a laurel-garland about his head, found in the
Picts wall near Drumburg castle.

The square plot of the city is very perfect, on the south side of
Brougham castle: it had a broad ditch round it. The castle stands on
the north end of it, and was built of its wall; the track of which is
visible upon the edge of the _vallum_. The high ground by Countess
pillar, where most of the inscriptions were found, seems to have been
the site of the city, and this the castle or fort; the Roman road lying
between. A good way farther on the road toward Kirkby, there is a
hawthorn-tree with a buck’s horns fastened upon it: this stands by one
of great note and antiquity, now decayed, where was a brass plate of

    “Hercules kill’d Hart of Greece,
     And Hart of Greece kill’d Hercules.”

They say the bark of the tree had covered the bottom of the horns for a
great many inches.

In the church-yard of Penrith is a monument of a giant, Sir Owen
Cæsarius, a knight, I suppose, of their king Arthur; two pyramidal
stones with rude carvings and letters on them, seemingly Runic. This
church is new built, and fitted up very handsomely. Selden speaks of an
image at Lowther. There is a castle at Penrith in the upper part of the
town. Over-against Brougham is Isanparles, an odd rock.

The Madan-way goes over Cross-fell very perfect: an inscription on
the side of a house built upon it: it goes to Barwic on the Wall.
Cross-fell is the highest ground hereabouts; they can see the Irish sea
from thence. A fine meadow by the river side over-against the Roman
_castrum_. The stones of the city are of a different sort from those of
the country.

Mr. Gale says there is such a work as the round table near his house in
Yorkshire, with many barrows near it. Mayborough is finely incircled
by the river Eimot, which is very deep. Dr. Hugh Todd, minister of
Penrith, has a great collection of antiquities.

Many Roman inscriptions have been found lately at Netherhall, by the
sea side near Workington, which are placed on the stable-wall at lord
Lonsdale’s there. The fine inscription at the end of Clifton house has
been there for 300 years, exposed to the rain and weather; so that the
inscription is worn away; only it seems that _imper. legat. aug. in
Africa_, is just visible. Another inscription is on the inside of the
barn there. Some Roman carvings on the quarry whence the pillars of
Penrith church were taken. I saw a Roman vessel of copper found near
Clifton: it is deep, with a handle to it like a skillet, on which is
stamped the maker’s name, TALIOF: within this is placed a cullender,
and within that another: the use of it, I guess, was to carry lighted
charcoal in, at the sacrifices. The spring below Clifton is a pretty
grotto, much talked of, where, as I said, the anniversary meeting is on
May-day. The great barrow incompassed with stones, by the Eimot side,
is called Haransley hill.


                               LONG MEG.

Mr. Patten and I went to view that famous monument of antiquity called
Long Meg and her Daughters, in the parish of Addingham, between Little
Salkeld and Glasenby. It stands upon a barren elevated plain of high
ground, under the vast hill called Cross-fell, to the east. This plain
declines to the east gently, or rather north-east, for that I find to
be the principal line observed by the founders. It is a great Celtic
temple, being a circle of 300 foot diameter, consisting of 100 stones:
they are of unequal bulk; some are of very large dimensions: many are
standing, but more fallen, and several carried away; but lately they
have destroyed some by blasting, as they call it, i. e. blowing them in
pieces with gunpowder; others they have sawed for mill-stones: but the
major part remaining, gives one a just idea of the whole; and it is a
most noble work. The stones are not all of the same kind; some made of
square crystallisations, of the same sort as those at Shap; and I saw
many of that sort of stone scattered about the country; others of the
blue, hard, flaky sort, like those of the temple at Mayborough. The
intervals are not exactly equal, but judiciously adapted to the bulks
of the stones, to preserve as much as possible a regular appearance.
This large ring, thus declining north-east, is now parted through by
a ditch; so that the larger half lies in an inclosure, the other in
a common; and the road lies by the side of it, that goes from Little
Salkeld to Glasenby. South-west from it, seventy foot, stands a very
great and high stone, called Long Meg, of a reddish girt, seeming to
have been taken from the side of some quarry of the country: I think
it leans a little north-east: it is about fifteen foot high. In the
middle of the circle are two roundish plots of ground, of a different
colour from the rest apparently, and more stony and barren; which
probably were the immediate places of burning the sacrifices, or the
like. Not far hence toward Glasenby is a very fine spring; whence,
no doubt, they had the element of water, used at their religious
solemnities: and higher up the field is a large spring, intrenched
about with a _vallum_ and foss, of a pretty great circumference, but
no depth. Full south-west from this work, in the next inclosure and
higher ground, is another circle of lesser stones, in number twenty:
the circle is fifty foot diameter; and at some distance above it is
another stone placed, regarding it, as Meg does the larger circle. In
that part of the greater circle next the single stone called Meg, are
two stones standing beyond the circle a little, and another fallen;
which I believe were a sort of _sacellum_, perhaps for the _pontifex_
to officiate in: and westward is another stone or two, perhaps of a
like work; but the ruinous condition of the work would not admit of any
certainty about it.


                               KESWICK.

We continued our journey through this rough country, and passed half
round the bottom of the famous Skidhaw, a high mountain named from
its fancied likewise to a shoe (_yscyd_.) Penruddoc, a town near it,
with a Welsh name. These desolate and hilly regions were the retiring
places of the Britons from the power of the Romans; which perhaps is
the reason of the great number of temples scattered throughout the
country; for a mile before we came to Keswick, on an eminence in the
middle of a great concavity of those rude hills, and not far from the
banks of the river Greata, I observed another Celtic work, very intire:
it is 100 foot in diameter, and consists of forty stones, some very
large. At the east end of it is a grave, made of such other stones, in
number about ten: this is placed in the very east point of the circle,
and within it: there is not a stone wanting, though some are removed
a little out of their first station: they call it the Carsles, and,
corruptly I suppose, Castle-rig. There seemed to be another larger
circle in the next pasture toward the town.

The ascent to this hill (Skidhaw) is from the east; for the west side
of it is exceeding steep, and drawn down into frightful ribs, like the
roots of a tree. There is a place on the top called Skidhaw maen; a
kind of sea-mark, by what information I could get: it seems to be a
_kist-vaen_. Cnut-berries grow a-top of it, a delicious fruit.

There is no doubt, that when the globe of the earth received its
motion round its _axis_, all the solid parts of metals, minerals
and stone, flew to the outward parts at farthest distance from the
centre, contrary to the assumption of our theorists, and the laws
of Nature; for which reason we find the most hard materials on the
highest mountains: these by time, and the heat of the external air,
consolidated, and left great cavities lower down, when the matter
underneath came closer together, and could not bring down these
arch-like bodies: at length, when the parts of the globe became
accustomed to this motion, the remainder of its internal matter I will
allow to sink according to its specific gravity; and questionless the
central constituents are heavier than that between it and the present
surface; and probably this is fluid. Supposing then the matter of
iron-stone fell to the centre, it formed a great magnet, according
to Dr. Halley’s _hypothesis_, and may have a liberty of turning
round itself with a slow motion, the intermediate fluid giving it
that liberty; though, as to a subterraneous world, as that famous
mathematician would suggest, I cannot believe the least of it: but this
internal magnet, being not fastened to the whole earth, will naturally,
as he supposes, have a motion of its own, somewhat different from that
of the earth, and retain a regular revolution of that motion; which
solves the famous variation of the magnetic needle.

Keswick is placed in a narrow bottom, under these vast mountains, which
seem to hang over our heads. There is a place called Castle-head, a
great rock, which has, no doubt, been a castle, I fancy in British
times, and called a _caer_, whence the name of the town, _Caerswic_,
as _Keston_ in Kent, from the camp there, originally _Caerston_. Here
are variety of mines hereabouts; some of lead, some of copper, and
others of black-lead, which is no contemptible manufacture: there are
scarce any other black lead mines, but what are here; they use it for
glasing pots: it lies pretty much above ground. In our way hither we
had sight of that vast receptacle of water called Ulles lake; and, when
going hence to Cockermouth, we rode all along the side of a great lake
upon the river Derwent. These collections of fluid element are owing
to the rocks, which suffer not the water thoroughly to drain out of
the valleys. When one stands at the end of these lakes, the prospect
is exceeding delightful; the mountains on each side rising to a great
height, one behind another the whole length, and broke off into short
ones, like the scenes at a playhouse: nor need a painter go to Italy
for variety and grandeur of prospects. Though the sides of these hills
are very stony, and even rocks of marble, yet the valleys every where
look very green, and produce great crops, in years when they have a
reasonable share of dry weather: but that, I believe, is not very
frequent; for the hills will scarce suffer any clouds to pass over from
any quarter, but dash them in pieces; so that the frequency of springs
and cascades, and the rapidity and force of the brooks and rivers, is
wonderful.

                             COCKERMOUTH.

At this place they manufacture cotton yarn for candlewicks. It owes
its name to the river Cocker, here emptying itself into the Derwent.
The castle belonging to the dukes of Somerset stands in the angle of
union, and very pleasantly: the valley is rich ground: it was a stately
building, and strong in the old manner; but now they daily pull it
down for the sake of its materials. They report that the earth of the
_vallum_ on the outside the walls was fetched from Ireland, whence no
venomous creature can pass over it. A fine vault here, which they call
the Chapel.


                       OLENACVM. +Elenborough.+

[Sidenote: TAB. LXIII.]

Going toward this Roman station, we passed the river Derwent, and over
a moor not far from the sea, where are coal-mines. Elenborough is a
little village on the river Elen, the daughter of a great Roman city,
which has produced a copious and instructive harvest of antiquities; as
may be seen in Mr. Camden, p. 826. I quote Dr. Gibson’s first edition;
for his second does disgrace this most excellent author, by mixing the
notes with his masterly text. Here that great genius of old Britain,
with Sir Robert Cotton, was entertained by the ancestor of the present
possessor, Humphrey Senhouse, esq; who inherits a true love for these
studies. His seat is on the other side the river: the walls of the
house are incrusted over, as we may say, with inscriptions, carvings,
and bas reliefs, taken from the ruins of the Roman city. The first
cohort of the Dalmatians, the first cohort of the Spaniards, and the
first cohort of the Bœtasians, here kept garrison; as appears by the
inscriptions.

[Sidenote: TAB. LXX. LXXI.]

That noble altar now at Sir James Lowther’s, at Whitehaven, belongs
to this place; the grandest yet seen in Britain: it is five foot and
a half high: on the back, VOLANTI VIVAS import a sacred wish for the
prosperity of his friend Volantius, hoping to see him again. Mr. Gale
has observed several of this sort in Gruter.

In the wall of Mr. Senhouse’s dwelling is a curiosity seldom to be met
with; a very large stone, whereon a man on horseback is designed to be
carved, but left unfinished: it is a pleasure to see only the sketch
of a Roman artist; and we are not to suspect these works here are so
barbarous as our authors make them, for want of proper skill in drawing.

[Sidenote: TAB. LXXII.]

There is another _relievo_ of a lady sacrificing, which by the
compartment of the inscription at bottom, though worn out, seems to
have been fixed upon a temple by the founders. A most stately altar is
placed in the middle of the garden, with a sun-dial on the _discus_.
Some are somewhat more securely set up within the porch: many given
away; as, one to the bishop of the Isle of Man; another, to Wm. Kirkby
esq; at Ashlec in Kirkby, Lancashire: two altars lately found are
placed upon a farm-house, which is now commonly known by the name of
_Volantium_, falsely fixed upon this station: this is by the sea-side
in Mr. Senhouse’s demesnes. It is much to be lamented that these fine
remains should now be exposed to the weather.[B]

The _castrum_ is just 400 foot square, two ditches about it, and three
entrances: it had likewise a stone wall on the high _vallum_. On the
north side of this _castrum_ lay the city OLENACVM, of a great extent,
as is plain from the ruins of it, but dug up all about. The family of
the Senhouses, and the Eaglesfields whose heiress they married, have
been continually digging here; and the ruins are still inexhaustible:
the dwelling-house and all the out-houses are built from it, as from a
quarry: hundreds of cart-loads of hewn stone now lie there.

One may trace many square plots of the houses, and of the streets,
paved with broad flag-stones, that are visibly worn with use. All
the walls that divide the pastures are made of these squared stones:
I saw innumerable of them upon the spot, with mouldings on them of
various sorts, gutter-stones, architraves, cornices, &c. The faces
of the squared stones are generally not perfectly smoothed, but have
the mark of the axe upon them; and I see many such sort of masonry in
the old gates of London. Coins innumerable have been found formerly,
now but seldom; urns, and other antiquities, which it is endless to
particularise.

Mr. Senhouse told me there is a paved military way, besides the streets
of the city, going hence northward along the sea-coast; another, to
Papcastle by Cockermouth. Most of the inscriptions are found in the
city and precincts; bits of altars, and fragments. In the castle are
many vaults still left. The altar at Sir James Lowther’s was found in
the north-west angle of the castle, on the _vallum_.

Here is a most magnificent prospect of the Scotch coast of Galway, and
of the great sea between the two kingdoms. In the evening, when the sun
shines, and it is clear weather, the lights and shadows of those lofty
hills are extremely entertaining. The Isle of Man appears perfectly.

The river Elen did not empty itself, formerly, directly into the ocean,
as at present, but went northward under the cliff, till it came under
the castle: the old channel of it is visible: the sea has eaten away
a large quantity of marsh and high ground between it and the castle.
To this elbow of land, which made the mouth of the river, is the name
OLENACVM owing. They talk likewise of anchors being found thereabouts:
many Roman hand-mill stones found at Elenborough. I imagine this river
is one of the Alaunas. Toward Cockermouth the western roots of the
Cumbrian hills being very steep, exhibit a most curious spectacle; the
declining sun shining on them from over the Irish sea; so that we need
not travel to the Alps for magnificent views of this nature.


                              PAPCASTLE.

A mile off Cockermouth, on the north side of the river, lies this
Roman station. The river water is very clear, according to its name,
notwithstanding the floods here, owing to its running through rocky
ground. The Roman _castrum_ lies upon the top of the hill, above
the village. I soon traced out its whole circumference, though the
inhabitants had not the least notion of where it stood, supposing it
to be lower down. I saw a bit of the Roman wall, which they wonder at,
because it strikes fire when struck upon with a pick-axe, by reason
of the hardness of the mortar: it lies by the road-side going to
Wigton; and there the ditch is plainly visible, though half filled up
with the rubbish of the wall. The whole town, and perhaps Cockermouth
castle and town, are built out of it; likewise the walls of all the
pastures and corn-fields adjoining. Free-stone cut is very common,
which they say must have been fetched a good way off, because there is
none such in the neighbourhood; and a great deal of ashler is still
left in the ground. The field upon the top of the hill, the highest
part of the _castrum_, is called the Boroughs. A man told me he found
a hand mill-stone about the bulk of his hat, which he admired for its
prettiness: he found a Roman coin too of Claudius, and others; but
they are lost. Several other people told me they found coins upon
the side of the hill; and the children pick them up after a shower
of rain. Mr. Senhouse showed me a silver Geta, _pont._ reverse,
_princeps juventutis_, among others found here. The famous font, now
at Bridekirk, was taken up at this place, in the pasture south of the
south-east angle of the city, by the lane called Moor-went. In the same
place lately they found a subterraneous vault, floored with free-stone,
of very large dimensions; the top of it made with the same sort of
stone, all brought a distance off. The name of Boroughs includes both
closes where the old city, or rather _castrum_, stood; for they find
stones and slates with iron pins in them, coins, and all other matters
of antiquity, upon the whole spot below the _castrum_, toward the water
side. This was a beautiful and well-chosen place, a south-west side of
a hill, a most noble river running under it, and a pretty good country
about it, as one may judge by the churches; for that I find generally a
good criterion of the goodness of a country, as Mr. Senhouse observed,
who accompanied me hither. On the side of the hill are many pretty
springs: at one of them we drank a bottle of wine, to the memory of the
founders; then poured some of the red juice into the fountain-head,
to the Nymph of the place. A person told us he had dug up, in the
Boroughs, the foundation of a wall where the stones were laid slanting
side by side, and liquid mortar poured upon them, as was often the
Roman method; likewise several floors made of cement. The kind of
slates dug up here, are brought too a good way off. Mr. Senhouse
says he can trace the remains of the Roman road between this place
and Elenborough in many places. This certainly was a town thoroughly
peopled; and perhaps its name was _Derventio_, because standing upon
this river Derwent. Fitz-house is on the south side of the river. Mr.
Gilpin of Whitehaven has seen many Roman coins found at Papcastle,
especially of Adrian.


                             WHITE-HAVEN.

This is a new sea-port town, standing in a little bay, sprung up from
its conveniency for the coal-mines hard by. There are many salt-works
upon this coast. Rock-samphire grows here. This western country, left
beyond the monstrous hills, is sand and clay. Skidhaw is in view from
hence, and with the rest deceives one exceedingly in its distance; for
one of these hills, which we should be apt to compute a mile off, is
seven; the eye judging according to the angle it makes from the horizon
in such objects as it has been accustomed to. Here is but a small
rivulet, which is a detriment to the haven, for want of scowering. They
transport great quantities of coals to Ireland and other places. We
walked two miles in these coal-works, the _stratum_ of pure coal being
all the way about ten foot thick, declining gradually, about one foot
in five, till we got 300 foot below the surface; a rock of stone over
head all along. Their method of digging is generally to run the grooves
in a strait line, others going out on both sides at right angles; so
that square pillars of coal are left to support the incumbent rock:
hence some roads are made along the descent, the others parallel to its
declivity. There are trappings now and then, but not very frequent,
nor great; and those are both along the declivity, and sideways. Their
methods of conveying the coal to the shafts where they are drawn
up, and of conveying air from one passage to the other, to prevent
damps and stagnations, and of drawing up the water from one height
to another, are very dextrous, and worth seeing. At last the famous
fire-engine discharges the water, which is a notable piece of machinery
working itself intirely: it creates a _vacuum_ by first rarifying the
air with hot steam, then condenses it suddenly by cold water; whence
a piston is drawn up and down alternately, at one end of a beam: this
actuates a pump at the other end, which, let down into the works,
draws the water out: it makes about 14 strokes in a minute; so that
it empties 140 hogsheads in an hour, with moderate working. With this
quantity of declivity it goes toward the sea, and below its level at
present; and so, no doubt, proceeds under the sea as far as the outward
shell of the globe reaches. From this it is most indisputable, that the
convex thereof is formed into a spiral figure of layers of different
materials; and it must be owing to the first rotation of the earth upon
its own axis.

Here is likewise a great copperas work, which is effected by laying a
great quantity of sulphurous and ferruginous earth into a great yard,
walled about. This stuff is partly got out of the coal-mines, and out
of the adjacent hills; in long tract of time the rains falling here,
and passing through this earth, drain into a receptacle; into that
they put all the old iron they can get, which it eats up presently:
this is boiled to a proper degree of evaporation, then is let into
leaden cisterns, where it crystallises against the sides of the vessels
in pure copperas: it shoots into figures of regular surfaces, some
triangular, others hexangular, &c.


                               MORBIVM,

Moresby, a mile north of Whitehaven. Here is a Roman _castrum_,
notorious enough, at some distance, by its elevation above the plain of
the field it stands in. This is one of the castles built at convenient
intervals along this coast, to guard against the depredations of the
Scots by sea: it lies upon a piece of high ground in a valley, bounded
by higher all around, except seaward. Parton haven, where they are
now making a new pier, is on one side; and a large creek, or little
bay, on the other. The wall that stood on the edge of the _vallum_ was
just 400 foot square, as that at Elenborough. There is a great dry
wall of stones now stands in its place, the stones taken originally
from it: they are all squared: the stones of all the pastures, fences,
and houses round about, and the stones of Mr. Brome’s house, and the
churches, are most evidently taken thence; being of the Roman cut, as
the inhabitants take notice, and wonder at it: they own the stone is of
a different grit from that of the place.

The site of the Roman castle has been ploughed up. Many coins and urns
found about the place; stones in great quantities still within the
place: I saw one squarish, of a very large bulk. A reddish sort of
slate to cover houses is dug here; they do not know of any such nearer
than Scotland: such was the indefatigable labour of the Romans. There
is no ditch about this castle; but the _vallum_ is pretty high quite
round. The church stands on the east side of it: in the church-yard is
an ash-tree, that bends eastward fifty foot from the stem, by the force
of the westerly winds continually pressing on it.

The new front of the hall is of an excellent model; I doubt not but it
is from some of the admirable Inigo Jones’s designs: the inside is of
the same relish. The Isle of Man is very clearly discerned from this
place; and the Scotch coast quite to the mull of Galway: it is about
thirty miles off.

In some pastures a little east of the place I saw a flat stone set
upright by the road-side, and converted into a stile: it was a monument
of some young Roman, but pretty much worn: he is robed with a _toga_,
and holds a scroll in his right hand, to denote his being a scholar,
perhaps a pleader, a disciple of the famous Papinian. I could not see
to the bottom of it, where probably is an inscription. The man that
rents the ground says it was found in the ditch, under the hedge, a
little lower down.

At the next stile of the same pasture is another monumental stone of
an old man; for such seems to be the head cut in the _tympanum_ above.
The inscription upon it is scarce legible: it was poorly cut at first,
and has been thus long exposed with the face upwards; and because it
is somewhat broader than the wall, and was apt to fall down, the man
knocked off all one side of it: he has been courted with money and fair
words to part with it, but in vain. Thus, as well as I can judge, the
inscription should be read:

_Dis Manibus sacrum Mertio Maximo, militum phractariorum equestori,
stipendiorum decem, vixit triginta quinque annos._

There are evident signs of a Roman road from _Morbium_ to Papcastle
all the way, especially over the moor. The soil all along to the
west of the Cumbrian hills, between them and the sea, is sandy, with
rock underneath, sometimes lime-stone, sometimes of the red stone.
_Morbium_, in the _Notitia_, is said to be the station of the _numerus
cataphractariorum_; and the inscription above proves it.

There were six Roman castles against this western shore in Cumberland;
a cohort in each took up half a legion to garrison: they are ten
miles distant from each other; Mawborough, ten miles from Boulness;
Elenborough; _Morbium_; another at Egremont; _Maglove_, Ravenglass. I
suppose they were made by Stilico, who is celebrated for it in Claudian.

    _Me quoque vicinis pereuntem gentibus inquit,
    Munivit Stilico totam cum Scotus Hiernem
    Movit & infesto spumavit remige Thetis.
    Illius effectum curis, ne bella timerem
    Scotica; nec Pictum tremeres ne littore toto
    Prospicerem dubiis venientem Saxona ventis._

He was general to Theodosius.


                         CASTRVM EXPLORATORVM.

Now called Old Carlisle; a mile off Wigton, upon an eminence: the
fairest show of foundations I ever yet saw: one might almost draw
an intire plan of it, and of every dwelling. The _castrum_ was
double-ditched, 500 foot from south-east to north-west, 400 the other
way: the wall has been dug up to the foundations; but the hollow where
it stood on the edge of the rampart appears quite round, and the track
of all the streets and buildings obvious. A street of forty foot wide
quite round the inside of the wall. From the north-east entrance two
Roman roads depart; one full north, as far as we could see, paved with
coggles; on each side of it are the square plots of houses: the other
road marches north-east, paved in like manner; it passes over two
great moors, and there it is very apparent: we travelled along it to
Carlisle. I saw a group of barrows near it. Many antiquities have been
found at Old Carlisle, and inscriptions; one on the side of a house a
mile off Wigton, as Mr. Gilpin told me: others are at Ilkirk.

There are several springs all round the bottom of the hill, and
quarries; and an extensive prospect, especially toward the sea-shore.
Some coal-works in our journey from Cockermouth hither. I doubt not but
the Romans had knowledge of this subterraneous treasure, though they
neglected it, because there was wood enough in their time: but Solinus
mentions it among the wonders of Britain, that they burnt _globos
saxeos_ into ashes. I saw a silver Antoninus Pius found here; reverse,
_rector orbis_.

    _Latius arctoi præconia persequar amnis.
    Addam urbis tacito subterlaveris alveo
    Mœniaque antiquis te prospectantia muris.
    Addam præsidiis dubiarum condita rerum._

                                                            +Ausonius.+


                        LVGVVALVM. +Carlisle.+

At the gates are guard-houses of stone, built by Cromwell from the
demolished cathedral; and in the middle of the market-place, a fort
with four bastions, roofed like a house, with holes for the gunners
to shoot out at with small arms. At the south-east end of the city
is a citadel built by Henry VIII. as is plain from its conformity to
Deal, Walmer, &c. In levelling the ground of the fish-market they
found many coins, which we saw in Mr. Goodman’s hands: he has an altar
found in the river Irthing, by the Picts wall: also in Mr. Stanwix’s
summer-house wall is an inscription of the sixth legion, and a pretty
altar, but the inscription worn out. Fragments of Roman squared stones
appear in every quarter of the city, and several square wells in the
streets, of Roman workmanship. A great quantity of Roman coin dug up
under St. Cuthbert’s church. Probably the city stood chiefly on that
spot where the castle now is, as the highest ground, but did not reach
so far eastward as the present city. One may walk about the walls of
this city, as at Chester: there was a double ditch round it.

There are many hollowed stones found hereabouts, much like the marble
mortars of apothecaries, with a notch in them. I take them to be the
hand-mills of the Roman soldiers, wherein they ground their corn with
a stone, and sometimes perhaps became their urns; making their chief
instrument in sustentation of life, their inseparable companion in
death.

This is a very pleasant and fertile country, rendered more sightly
to us by passing so long through the mountainous stoney tracts of
Lancashire, Westmorland, and Cumberland. About this country we observe
many mud-wall houses, thatched with flat sods or hassocks shaved off
the moors; which I suppose the old British custom continued. Here too
they use the little carts, as about Kendal.

We saw, in Mr. Gilpin’s hands, a silver Otho, found here; reverse,
SECVRITAS R. P. also a middle brass of C. Marius; reverse, VICTORIA
CIMBRICA: together with many more, which his father collected. In the
cathedral are many remains of the tombs of bishops, I suppose, between
the pillars of the choir; every one of which was a little chapel, but
now pulled in pieces. A large brass of bishop Bell is left in the
choir. The bottom of the steeple, and the west end of what remains of
the structure, is of William Rufus’s time: the choir is later.

The road to Bramton is manifestly Roman, by reason of its straightness;
and in two places, as I walked up the first hill, I saw the original,
made of a bed of stone: it goes precisely south-east; and looking
towards Carlisle, I saw it passed through the citadel, and along a
narrow street; so through the cathedral to the castle-gate; all in a
strait line. To the castle-gate the road over the river Eden came: that
from the wall on the west came to the same point; into which falls that
from _castrum exploratorum_.


                             _The_ VALLVM.

The military virtue of the Romans outlived the spirit of their
learning, or excelled it, seeing there is no author that deservedly
celebrates this stupendous work of theirs in Britain: they just mention
it: no coins struck upon it. I am not afraid to set it in competition
with the wall of China, which necessarily occurs to our thoughts upon
this occasion: _that_ we readily acknowledge to be a structure of
greater bulk and length, which we esteem the least part of the wonder
in ours: the Romans intended no more, by their walls around their forts
and castles than to prevent a sudden surprise: their strength lay in
a living arm and head: in the open field they never refused fighting,
without much regard to opposite numbers; the additional security of a
little wall was all they asked, against emergencies.

Therefore the beauty and the contrivance of this wall consisted mostly
in the admirable disposition of the garrisons upon it, at such proper
stations, distance, strength and method, that even in times of profound
peace, as well as war, a few hands were sufficient to defend it against
a most bold and daring people, redundant in numbers, strong and hardy
in body, fierce in manners, as were the old North Britons, who refused
subjection and a polite life.

The Romans, tired out with the untractable disposition of these people,
whose country they judged not worth while wholly to conquer, resolved
to quit their strengths northward, and content themselves with the
desirable part of Britain, and, by one of the greatest works they ever
did, seclude the Caledonians, and immortalise their own name by an
inexhaustible fund of monuments, for posterity to admire. These people,
who had the true spirit of military discipline, did not lie idle under
arms, but were ever at work, even whilst they lay _pro castris_; making
and repairing public roads; setting up milliary pillars; building and
repairing castles, cities, temples, and palaces; erecting altars,
inscriptions; striking medals, and the like works, which we here find
in such surprising quantities.

If we consider the great numbers of their works now to be seen, more
that have been lost and destroyed, or put into new buildings of our
own, most that are still left for future times to rake out of their
vestiges, we may entertain a true notion of their genius, which subdued
the fiercest and most populous nations in the world. Worthily may we
propose them for examples of virtue and public spirit. This is no
little use and advantage of disquisitions of this sort.

Alliances, treaties, and negotiations, are of small value to a nation
always in arms, and ready to meet an injurious enemy; who strengthen,
fortify, and enrich themselves at home, protect the people, and make
the expences of government sit easy upon them; encourage industry,
frugality, temperance, virtue; a few plain easy laws; administer
justice with expedition, and without expence; but especially encourage
a due sense of religion and morality: and how much easier and more
effectually that is to be done now, than possibly could be done by
the Romans, will appear notorious, when we consider, that under the
Christian dispensation we make a much stronger impression on the
hearts and minds of people, than before: the full certainty, which
all reasonable consciences must now have, of a future retribution and
account to be made before an omniscient judge, lays an infinitely
greater restraint on our actions, than possibly can be had from the
terror of rods and axes.

The Roman wall is called by the people _Pights wall_, with a guttural
pronunciation, which we of the south cannot imitate; and which the
Romans called _Picti_; but not from any fancied painting of their
bodies, though it gave a handle to it.

At Stanwick, which hence has its name, just over-against Carlisle
beyond the river, I saw the ditch very plain: the blacksmith there,
told me he had taken up many of the stones of the foundation of the
wall: it passes the river over-against Carlisle castle. At Stanwick
was an arched gate through the wall: Mr. Goodman showed us a cornelian
_intaglia_ found there, of Jupiter sitting. I followed the wall
to Taraby, where, a little beyond, it makes an angle, going more
south-east; so to Draw-dikes, which was a fort, about 100 foot square:
it is on the edge of the meadows, and moist in situation. Here I found
an inscription upon the house-wall.

In building the wall, I observed evidently, the intent of the
projectors was to conduct it, all along, upon the northern edge of the
high ground, as near as might be. All about Carlisle, this most noble
monument of Roman power and policy is pulled up; first, perhaps, by
William Rufus, when he built the castle; then for the cathedral: and
I suppose all the church walls of the city, and houses of it, and the
villages near it, are of the pillage: hence most of the churches along
the wall are set upon it, for the convenience of having stone near at
hand, ready cut. The farmers and inhabitants are daily taking away the
small remains.

The track of the ditch on the north side of the wall is visible enough
all the way, though sometimes corn grows in it. The line where the wall
stood, is generally a foot-path. The valley between the end of the wall
at Stanwick, and the castle of Carlisle, is not above 300 yards broad,
and is guarded too by the stream of the river Cauda. Westward, on the
south side of the river Eden, it went toward Drumburgh, and ended at
Boulness. Why the Romans carried it so far, on the south side the bay,
was because of its being a flat shore, where an enemy might land in
boats. It goes up the hill at Newton, from Carlisle; and so marches
in a strait line up the next hill, to Beaumont, one of the old forts.
All this way it is turned into a street: the ridge of the wall is the
foundation of it, as a pavement; the ditch pretty much filled up by
rubbish. Mr. Goodman says, he remembers two forts near Carlisle, now
demolished, and ploughed over; one on the north side the river; the
other on the south. I cannot suppose the stone work of the _wall_ went
across the meadow; rather a wood work with towers, which made up the
communication between the two ends of the _wall_, over the river.

The fort on the north side of the river was on the high plat of ground,
between the road up to Stanwick, and the _wall_. At the place where the
ditch ends over the river, has been some little fortification work; and
thereabouts is a pretty little spring, faced with stone, and having a
stone bason. Hitherto the _wall_ was carried; because directly opposite
to the union of the Cauda and Eden rivers, running close under the
bank; and directly opposite to the western steep of Carlisle castle,
which was the Roman _castrum_, but somewhat larger than this castle of
William Rufus: perhaps it took in most of the present city. In a tower
of the walls of Carlisle castle, on the outside, between it and the
Irish gate, I saw a Roman carving of a boar, which was the cognisance
of the legion here in garrison, and that built it.

We visited Scaleby castle, Mr. Gilpin’s seat, about half a mile from
the _wall_, and built of its stones. This was a strong place with
a circular mote, well beset with wood, which is not very common
hereabouts. In the garden we copied many Roman altars: they showed us
two Roman shoes, found in the bog hereabouts. The church too of this
place was built out of the _wall_. Mr. Gilpin says, in taking up the
foundation of the _wall_ at a boggy place, they found a frame of oak
timber underneath, very firm.

From hence, over a most dismal boggy moor, an uncultivated desert, we
travelled to Netherby. We passed by a Roman fort upon the river Leven,
where antiquities have been found. They tell us, that, for sixty miles
further up northward, there is scarce a house or tree to be seen, all
the way. This was the march, or bound, between the two kingdoms. The
land might be drained and cultivated, and how much a greater argument
of national prudence would it be to have it done, by those we transport
to America!

The foundations of the Roman _castrum_ at Netherby appear round the
house, or present castle: it stood on an eminence near the river. Many
antiquities are here dug up every day. The foundations of houses, and
the streets, are visible. They pretend, most of the space between
the _vallum_ and ditch is vaulted. A little lower down has been some
monumental edifice, or burial-place, where they find many urns and
sepulchral antiquities.

In the garden here, are some altars; and a carving of a female head,
in a lion’s skin; I suppose, _Omphale_; and an admirable carving of a
Genius sacrificing. We saw a gold _Nero_ found here: a cornelian with
a woman’s head, flowing hair. This valley by the river side is very
good land, with some shadow of Nature’s beautiful face left; but every
where else about us, is the most melancholy dreary view I ever beheld,
and as the back-door of creation; here and there a castellate house by
the river, whither at night the cattle are all driven for security from
the borderers: as for the houses of the cottagers, they are mean beyond
imagination; made of mud, and thatched with turf, without windows, only
one story; the people almost naked.

We returned through Longton, a market-town, whose streets are wholly
composed of such kind of structure: the piles of turf for firing are
generally as large and as handsome as the houses.

    _Quanta Calydonios attollet gloria campos
    Cum tibi longævus referet trucis incola terræ
    Hic suetus dare jura parens: hoc cespite turmas
    Affari: nitidas speculas, castellaque longe

    Belligeris hic dona deis, hæc tela dicavit
    Cernis adhuc titulos: hunc ipse vacantibus armis
    Induit: hunc regi rapuit thoraca Britanno._

                                                   +Statius+ V. Sylvar.

After this excursion northward, we set out from Carlisle eastward,
withinside of the Roman _vallum_. Warwick, thought a Roman station,
upon the river Eden, pleasantly seated in a little woody valley. We
left the Roman road going strait from the citadel of Carlisle to
_Petrianis_. To the right a little is Corby castle, where are many
monuments of antiquity preserved; as likewise at Caercaroc near it.

Upon the river Gelt, a little before we came to Bramton, we went up
the river to see a Roman inscription, cut upon the natural rock; a
most odd and melancholy place: the river runs through a canal of rock
all the way. Upon the great ridge of fells coming hither from Cross
fell by Penrith, are many circles of stones, and circular banks of
earth, the temples of the Druids of the patriarchal mode. There are
likewise square works set round with stones, which were their places of
judicature.

Beyond Bramton, just over the town, is a keep ditched about, called
the Mount, on the top of a hill. Hence to Thirlwal castle we rode
upon the foundation of the _wall_, the river Irthing accompanying us.
We visited Knaworth castle. Near here is a great house of the Howard
family, built of stone, and castellated: among many family pictures,
the great earl of Arundel’s, the reviver of learned curiosity among
us; a library once well stored with books and manuscripts: here is the
famous Glassonbury-abbey book, or rather screen, for it is big enough;
an account of the saints buried in that place. In the garden are many
altars and inscriptions: I copied all those tolerably fair: with much
regret I saw these noble monuments quite neglected and exposed; some
cut in half to make gate-posts. A fine park here, and much old timber.
The country hereabouts good land and pleasant. Above the house upon a
hill, a circular work double trenched; the outer ditch broadest.

About Thirlwall we rode along the side of the _wall_: here was a gate
through the wall, for the great Roman road called Madan-way. The name
Thirlwal retains a memory of the gate here; _foramen_: we use it now
to drill, and nostrill. All the fences of the inclosures, the houses,
church, and Thirlwal castle, built out of the ravage of the _wall_. At
the castle was a head of Roman carved work, which they have put into
the blind wall of a little ale-house.


                         VOREDA. +Caer Voran.+

A little upon the south side of the _wall_ was a great Roman city and
castle. We traversed the stately ruins: it stood on a piece of high
ground, about 400 foot square; had a wall and ditch; vestiges of houses
and buildings all over, within and without. We observed the Madan-way
coming over the fells from the south, where it passes by a work, or
labyrinth, called Julian’s bower. We saw too the Roman road passing
eastward along the _wall_. The country hereabouts is a wild moory bog;
and the _wall_ itself climbs all along a crag, and is set upon the
southern edge of it; the steepness of the cliff northward performing
the part of a foss. Near Haltwistle is Baliol castle, corruptly
Belister castle, said to be founded by a king of Scotland.

I suppose this wall, built by Severus, is generally set upon the same
track as Hadrian’s wall or _vallum_ of earth was; for, no doubt, they
then chose the most proper ground: but there is a _vallum_ and ditch
all the way accompanying the wall, and on the south side of it; and
likewise studiously chusing the southern declivity of rising ground. I
observe too the _vallum_ is always to the north. It is surprising, that
people should fancy this to be Hadrian’s _vallum_: it might possibly be
Hadrian’s work, but must be called the line of contravallation; for, in
my judgement, the true intent both of Hadrian’s _vallum_ and Severus’s
_wall_ was, in effect, to make a camp extending across the kingdom;
consequently was fortified both ways, north and south: at present the
wall was the north side of it; that called Hadrian’s work, the south
side of it: hence we may well suppose all the ground of this long
camp, comprehended between the wall and the southern rampire, was the
property of the soldiery that guarded the wall.

I remarked, that where the wall passes over a little rivulet, the
foundation of it is laid with broad, flat stones, square, having
intervals between, sufficiently large for the passage of the water.

At Haltwistle I got an altar of, DEO SOLI INVICTO. We took the wall
again at Chester on the Wall, about two miles east from _Caer voran_,
Wall town, lying between the Roman way paved with broad stones, which
led us over the low boggy ground up to the castle. It is a square of
400 foot close to the wall, which makes one side of it; 350 foot less
than those on the east and west. Great marks of buildings all over it,
and even side-walls of houses left. At the south entrance were two
round towers within side, and the cheeks of the gates. Last year one of
the iron hinges taken away. All around this castle were houses built.
An altar lies in the fields a little way off, but quite obliterated.

The Picts wall continues still on the southern verge of the cliff.
Eastward hence we saw, here and there, the vestiges of the square
towers, built on the inside of the Wall, and close to it: that called
Hadrian’s ditch runs still on the southern verge of the hill, with a
large _vallum_ on the north.

We came again upon the Roman road, which goes on the inside of the
wall, but not near it, chusing the best ground and shortest cut all the
way through this boggy waste country. Upon it is the compass of an
inn, or little station for lodging of travellers or soldiers. This road
continues very strait and bold to Little Chester, the next station, on
a brook, and somewhat better land. A mile before we came to it, on a
hill stands a great stone, and a little one, called the Mare and Foal.
A little west of that, over-against Chester, is a barrow which Mr.
Warburton dug through, and found bits of urns, ashes, and other like
marks of its being British. A little farther westward is a large group
of British barrows.

Before we come to Little Chester is a most noble column, or milestone,
set upon the road: it is of a large bulk and height, with an
inscription, but only not quite defaced. Mr. Gale thought he could read
TVNG. upon it: it is the finest stone of this sort I have seen, and
would have informed us who made the road.


                            LITTLE CHESTER.

[Sidenote: TAB. LXXV.]

We saw the _castrum_ here, of a square figure, hanging on a precipice
over a little river on the south side of the Roman road, and at
some distance from the Wall: it had been walled about, as others:
great _vestigia_ of buildings, altars, carved stones and antiquities
innumerable, have been found here, but now dispersed and gone. We saw
the mouths of vaults with great stones lying over them. The fences of
the pastures are made of the stones of the castle-wall. The man who
lives here showed us a few fragments of Roman work; a pine-apple, which
had been a pinacle on the top of a circular _tholus_; a piece of an
inscription within a civic garland, finely cut; a brick, with LEG. VI.
V. He has found many coins; but his children threw them away.

In a corner of a field below, by the side of the brook, and as the
military way turns, up the hill, is another such milliary stone, but no
inscription legible.

The moory country hereabouts has coal under it. Upon the tops of the
hills are several cairns, or sepulchral heaps of stones, made by the
old Britons.

A little eastward of Great Chester, where the ditch ends, at the bottom
of a cliff, we saw the foundation of the Wall, which the country people
are digging up for building: we measured the true breadth of it, just
seven Roman feet.


                             HOUSESTEEDS.

[Sidenote: TAB. LXXVI.]

The next station we visited, about two miles from the former, and by
the Wall, is deservedly called Housesteeds, from the _vestigia_ of the
houses therein, which are as easy to be seen and distinguished as if
ruined but yesterday. Approaching the farmer’s house there, I saw a
mill or two, i. e. the recipient stones of the hand-mills which the
Roman soldiers used to grind their corn with; likewise some tops of
altars: over the door of the house, a large carved stone, but defaced.
Going a little further, in a corner of a dry wall is a large stone that
has been curiously cut, but now broken and much injured: three figures
in it, in high relievo; two with sacrificing cups in their hands: I
believe it has belonged to some temple, and means the _Genii_ of three
cities: it is in my learned friend Mr. Horsley’s 20th table, but poorly
represented: they seem to stand before steps. Near it, in the wall, is
the bottom part of a very large altar, or pedestal of a pillar,
a yard square: near that a long carved stone, somewhat like the shaft
of our later crosses.

Above the house, upon the Picts wall is an altar; the legend gone.
As for fragments of pillars, or rollers, as they call them, they
lie scattered all over the place. A large part of a Doric capital
lies by the door, consisting of two _thori_, or swelled mouldings in
architectonic language.

But when we were led lower down into the meadow, we were surprised with
the august scene of Romano-British antiquities, in the most neglected
condition: a dozen most beautiful and large altars; as many fine _basso
relievo_’s, nearly as big as the life, all tumbled in a wet meadow by
a wall side, or one on the top of another, to make up the wall of the
close: the _basso relievo_’s, some with their heads down the hill;
particularly an admirable image of Victory, both arms knocked off: one
large soldier, a sepulchral stone, with his short sword hanging at his
right side, the man told us, was condemned to make a pig-trough on;
but some gentlemen, full timely, with a small sum, for the present
reprieved him: many soldiers with heads broke off; mutilated by the
middle: three ladies sitting close together, with globes in their
hands; their heads all gone.

Mr. Gale and I laboured hard at the inscriptions, and made out what
we could of them under all disadvantages. Along the same wall, as we
walked on further, we found more altars and carved stones of various
sorts: but at length the farmer carried us up to a knoll in the middle
of the meadow called Chapel-steed, where undoubtedly was the Roman
temple: there we saw three or four most beautiful altars; and a little
further, under another wall, a pretty sepulchral carving of an old
soldier’s upper part in a niche.

With great regret we left the place, deserving to be accounted the
Tadmor of Britain. The inscriptions being mostly of the captains of the
first cohort of the Tungrians, shows they were chiefly stationed here;
and then they had piety enough generally to erect such an altar, when
they took possession of their post.

We passed through Newborough. Just before the church, on the middle of
the street, stands an altar; but the legend vanished. I am informed,
that where the Roman wall passes the north Tyne, it is by a wonderful
bridge of great art, made with very large stones linked together with
iron cramps, fastened with molten lead.

We do not wonder at the great quantity of antiquities here to be seen,
when all the workmen of the Romans were generally got into Britain: as
is evident from the Panegyrist to Maximian, _sub finem_.

_Devotissima civitas Heduorum ex hac Britannicæ facultate victoriæ
plurimos quibus illæ provinciæ redundabant, accepit artifices, et
nunc extructione veterum domorum, et refectione operum publicorum et
templorum instauratione resurgit._

Two remarks are naturally inferred from this testimony. 1. How fond the
Romans were of this island; whence the cities, castles, roads, temples,
altars, sculptures, and in general the whole face of the country
here, vastly exceeded that of the continent. 2. When I returned home
from this journey, and compared my drawings of the antiquities here
exhibited, taken from the things themselves, with those that have been
published before or since, by Mr. Alexander Gordon, or Mr. Horsley; it
grieved me that, for want of a tolerable skill in design, they have
given us such poor and wretched pictures of these elegant antiquities;
so that the reader may not wonder when he views them both together:
and indeed it gives foreigners a mean idea of the Roman works in our
island; but very injuriously. I have therefore caused a good many of
these to be engraven, to show the just difference.

At Chesters an admirably carved stone was dug up lately, very large:
the tenant of the farm caused it to be planed and turned into a
grave-stone for himself; and it is now laid over him at the parish
church.


                                HEXAM.

Hexham has a fine appearance every way; stands on a hill in a pleasant
woody vale by the river Tyne; once a bishop’s see: the church dedicate
to St. Andrew by the great Wilfred, who was the occasion of bringing my
native country of Mercia to embrace christianity: he founded the priory
of St. Leonard’s, between Stamford and Uffington, the first of the
kingdom of Mercia: part of the church of his building remains, though
turned into a barn: he built St. Peter’s church in Stamford, the first
church there.

By Mr. Gale’s persuasion I wrote the whole _primordia_ of Stamford,
which I have by me. At Tickencote, hard by, is the most venerable
church antiquity extant, the intire oratory of prince Peada, who
founded Peterborough abbey. But return we to Hexam.

The cathedral is a large, lofty structure; but the body or west end,
and the two towers, are intirely demolished: it was collegiate: a
great building, called the College. Between it and the church are
cloisters, now a garden. In the choir two knightly monuments of stone
cross-legged; by the arms on their shields, Vernon and Umfrevile; they
either went a warfare into the Holy Land, or vowed it: a tomb of one of
the Northumbrian kings: two oratories over sepultures unknown: a tomb
of a woman with a veil over her eyes.

Here has been much old-fashioned painting, upon wainscot and stucco,
of bishops, saints, kings and queens; but, to the loss of history,
defaced. This town was undoubtedly Roman. We judged the _castrum_ was
where the castellated building now stands, east of the market-place;
which is the brow of a hill, and has a good prospect. The market-place,
which is a square, lies between this and the cathedral.

On the site of the cathedral once stood a Roman temple. Digging for a
foundation of a buttress to be built on the west side of the steeple,
they opened a vault, which descends under the church to a subterraneous
oratory, like that under the cupola of St. Peter’s at Rome, called
_limina apostolorum_. Here I suppose were kept the reliques of saints.
This place is built out of the ruins of the temple. Over the inward
entrance to the vault is laid flat a fine Roman inscription; the report
of which led us down thither, though the passage to it was as bad as
that of Poole’s hole, Derbyshire. We found it a noble large stone of
the emperors Pertinax and Aurelius: we could not transcribe the whole,
because part of it is still within the wall. Over the next door lower
down, a large stone is set perpendicular, and half of it cut away, in
nature of an arch: the mouldings likewise chopped off; the whole so
defaced, that nothing to any purpose could be made out of it, all the
words being imperfect. Upon the walls of the crypt we saw many Roman
fragments of mouldings, and carved work, with bits of fluted and cabled
pilasters.

In searching about the oratory we found a very fine altar almost
intire, laid sideways into the very foundation. We dug away the earth
and bones underneath, and discovered thereby a new _Legatus Augusti Q.
Calpurnius Concessinius_; and a new troop of horse in Britain, of which
he was the captain, the _equites Cæsareani Corionototarum_.

The ground-plot of this town is much like that of Caster in
Lincolnshire; four streets going diagonally from the angles of the
market-place. Some silver and other Roman coins were found not long
since near the church. This church is a very venerable and noble Saxon
structure, and may serve for a specimen of the manner of raising those
fabrics at that time of day. The workmen were but lately then brought
from Rome, by the great Benedict bishop of Weremouth, who may truly be
called the Arundel of that time: he was a nobleman of Northumberland,
minister to king Oswy: he travelled to Rome twice, some say five times;
and brought home a fine collection of books, of which the venerable
Bede made so good use: he also brought hither architects and artificers
in building, carving, painting on glass, and the like; so injurious
are the notions of some modern antiquaries, who think we had no stone
buildings before the Norman kings.

Our Wilfred was likewise a great genius: he travelled first to Rome
in Benedict’s retinue: he was a great promoter of building cathedrals
and religious houses: besides this of Hexam, he rebuilt that of York,
before raised by Paulinus: he built a cathedral in the old Roman city
of _Cambodunum_, Almondbury, in Yorkshire: he built Rippon cathedral:
he had a great hand in founding the cathedrals of Peterborough,
Ely, Litchfield, Leicester, and Chichester. He died in a good old
age, 12 Oct. anno Dom. 709, in his little monastery at Oundle,
Northamptonshire: the room still remains, and the church in ruins, but
later than his time.

The _Corionototarum_, in the inscription, is probably the
_Coriolopocarium_ in _anonymus Ravennas_; as Mr. Gale conjectures: and
I add, probably it was the neighbouring Corbridge.

The Roman castle was situate near the present Corbridge westward, and
on the northern banks of the river: it is called Corchester. They tell
us with some sort of wonder, that it is the richest and best hereabouts
for ploughing: they discern not that it is owing to the animal salts
left in a place that had been long inhabited. Corbridge is built out
of its ruins, which are scattered about there in every house. Before
the doors we saw many mills, pieces of shafts of pillars, capitals,
bases, many pieces of basso relievo, and carvings: a fine large picture
of Victory, holding a great _parma_, which belonged to the horse: two
carvings of lions tearing bulls; their heads knocked off: several bits
of inscriptions. The foot of the cross in the market-place is an intire
Roman altar, of a large size; the inscription worn out: on one side,
the head of a goat; a pitcher on the other. In the outer wall of the
chancel is a fragment of the fourth cohort of the second legion. In the
church-yard is the remarkable altar, in Greek character, to the Tyrian
Hercules: another imperfect one set up for a grave-stone.

In Mr. Tod’s house a fragment of a most noble inscription of the
emperor M. Aurelius, cut in very large and handsome letters: the date
of the _tribunicia potestas_ lost. I have endeavoured to do justice to
these elegant sculptures; whereas they are generally by others so very
ill done, as to be disgraceful both to Romans, and to Britons, and to
antiquity in general.

Over the door of a house, is a poor carving of a Northumbrian king,
with a sceptre in his hand, of the same style as their coins. There is
a fine bridge here over the river. From hence we travelled all along
upon the Roman road, on the northern banks of the Tyne, to Newcastle.
We saw Prudhoe castle on the other side of the river, standing on
an eminence; and a green mount, keep or _tumulus_, by the church of
Ryton. In the choir upon the ground lies the sepulchral monument of the
founder, probably; a lion at his feet; in his hands a square piece like
a book, with an eagle upon it.

At Newburn, as we passed, I saw a stone over a stable-door, next to
the sign of the boat; a tablet of the Roman fashion, ansated, cut in,
but the inscription worn out, as being exposed to the weather over the
river side.

The Roman wall leaves the common road about a mile east of Newburn, and
passes northward to recover the northern edge of the high ground; the
counter-guard ditch, called Hadrian’s, accompanying it _pari passu_. I
saw some more carved stones at Newburn, not worth reciting.

We leave Benwell on our right hand, a Roman station. The road two or
three miles west of Newcastle is very broad and strait, and enters the
west gate directly.

At East Denton, three miles west of Newcastle, is an inscription, in a
stable-wall, of the eighth cohort of the second legion.


                              NEWCASTLE.

This is a very large and populous town. The Picts wall ran along by the
north side of the road from Corbridge hither, upon a northern declivity
all the way, and in a strait line, on the north side of Newcastle.
The present castle was built where the Roman _castrum_ was, and the
Roman bridge: that and the walls of the town, the churches, and oldest
houses, are raised from the plunder of the Roman wall, which ought to
have been preserved as the noblest monument in Europe: it seems to have
gone across the present town, from the west gate to Pandon gate; and
lately, about the meeting-house, they dug up foundations of it: near
Pandon gate was found a seal-ring, now in Mr. Warburton’s possession.

One of the church steeples in this town is of a very ingenious model,
the original of one near London bridge. The bridge here is very long,
has houses on it: the arches and piers are rather larger than those of
London bridge. There is a ground-plot of this town lately made by an
artist. In some parts of this country, the ordinary people make a good
sort of ale called _hather_, that is, ling ale, by boiling the tops of
the Hather plant to a wort: then I suppose they put wormwood to it, and
ferment it.

The coal in this country, and which is universally diffused through
it, dips many ways, as the falls of valleys, or ducts of rivers,
occasionally divert its primary bent; but the main dip of it is to
the south-east. Sometimes here are fissures, or interruptions of
some considerable quantity, being coaled _strata_, stone, and other
materials jumbled together: this proves that there has been such a
partial disruption of the _strata_ of the earth, as we all along
suppose was effected by the Deluge; but not such a hotch-potch, or
total mixture and confusion, as others would pretend. It is objected
against our scheme, that the fishes in this deluge would be destroyed,
and so the renewal of them prevented; for, whether the water of the
flood was salt or fresh, or compound, yet this consequence must follow:
and indeed I allow it; but I suppose the eggs of these fishes renewed
the species, which, like the seeds of plants, would in an immense
quantity escape the storm, and provide for the succeeding world.
Immense are the quantities of coals transported from this _focus_ of
the kingdom; and the trade thereof is a perpetual source of seamen for
our navy. They speak very broad; so that, as one walks the streets, one
can scarce understand the common people, but are apt to fancy one’s
self in a foreign country. The perpetual clouds of smoke hovering in
the air makes every thing look black, as at London; and the falling of
it down must needs inrich all the ground round about.

It is an old proverb in this country, “As old as Pandon gate;” which
shows that there were formerly some ancient remains thereabouts; and
I believe the Picts wall went from thence, or rather somewhat above
it, i. e. north of it, directly across the town, to West gate; though
now the town is enlarged beyond it: nor was the old city, which stood
within the Wall, so broad to the east and west, as the present town,
but only filled up one of the eminences on which it now stands, having
deep valleys with brooks running through them on the sides. Again, it
may be inferred, there was a city or _castrum_ at Newcastle, because
the Wall on both sides runs in toward a point somewhat this way;
otherwise they ought to have carried it on by a straiter line north of
the town, and above it at some distance, and where it would better the
northern side of a declivity than at present; which was not so very
necessary when there was a city or castle here, beside _Gabrocentum_
on the other side of the water. Further, the ferry over the river here
would naturally erect a city for travellers northward.

Thus I conceive the intention and management of this famous work, the
Roman wall. It reaches 90 Roman miles: this is distributed into nine
parts by one of the largest castles, or cities: that interval has six
lesser castles. The names of the larger, till I am better informed, are
thus: 1. _Blatum Bulgium_, Boulness; 2. _Drumabon_, Drumburg castle;
3. _Luguvallum_, Carlisle; 4. _Amboglauna_, Castlesteeds; 5. _Voreda_,
Caer Voran; 6. _Borcovicus_, Housesteeds; 7. _Procolitia_, Caerhaw
brough; 8. _Hunnum_, Portgate; 9. _Vindolana_, Ruchester; 10. _Banna_,
Newcastle. The great castles were generally 400 foot square: these held
a cohort; the lesser held a maniple, or century: the first consisted of
600, the other of 120 men; for the Romans, in their military affairs
especially, reckoned by dozens. Thus the great castles contained a
full legion, 6000 men; the lesser, or centuries, a legion and half:
the cohorts were the standing garrison; the centuries were the watch:
for the Romans did not, as at present, set a single man to watch over
an army; but they watched by centuries, whence we have got the word
of standing _century_, without the thing. This I suppose the primary
disposition, whence it was provided that two legions and a half should
be a sufficient force to render this wall impregnable; and no doubt
it was so, as long as the Romans continued here. Further, upon the
mouths of the rivers were the fleets and galleys, to prevent the enemy
from passing them in their boats, as the _Cohors Ælia classica_ at
_Tunnocelum_, or Tynmouth, as the _Notitia Imperii_ in the last times
informs us. As also, of the disposition of the other troops along the
Wall, and castles adjacent at that time. Notwithstanding the foregoing
method of planting these castles, as the regular and primary intention
of the Romans, in such regular distances that they may relieve one
another as occasion requires; yet it must be understood with allowance,
and accordingly we find it so: they were not so strict as to plant
their castles at the alligned distances indiscriminately, for that
would be ridiculous; but chose out all along the nearest ground to
those distances, which by situation, on hills and the like, best suited
the end, for strength, prospect, water, and all other conveniencies:
they likewise placed them thinner, or more frequent, as the more or
less defensible parts of the Wall required.

[Sidenote: TAB. LXXVII.]

I pursued the Picts Wall beyond Pandon gate to Baker-mill hill, two
miles off eastward: it is very plain thither from Sandgate mill, both
the ridge of the wall, and ditch, the common road going beside it, and
many stones in the foundation left: it passes a very deep valley at
Euxburn, so ascends the opposite western hill very steep; a rivulet
running now in the ditch. Having mounted the hill, a coal-shaft is
sunk in the very ditch, and here is a square fort left upon the Wall:
some of the foundation of the wall of the fort, and of the Picts
Wall, is visible. This is upon an eminence, and sees from Newcastle
one way beside Benwell hill beyond it, where was another fort; and to
Baker-mill hill the other way, where no doubt was another; but a mill
and some farmhouses, standing thereon, have obliterated it. Between
here and Baker-mill hill both wall and ditch are very plain, the ditch
being deep, with a rivulet running along it: the present common road to
Tynmouth passes on its north side. The foundation of the wall is yet
intire within the pastures, and a considerable ridge of it is left.
Without the ditch is a coal-work lately set on fire, which vomits out
smoke continually, like a volcano: many more coal-works all about it.
From Baker-mill hill I observe it goes still forward eastward, in
a right line, upon the northern verge of the hills, as it has done
hitherto, till it comes pretty near the Tyne. From this hill I took a
prospect of its course Newcastle-ward; and the rather, because in all
probability, if, not from the fired coal-work at present, yet from some
others hereabouts, the country being intirely undermined, it may some
time or other sink, and disorder the track of this stately work.

Afterward I pursued the Wall westward out of west gate. As soon as I
passed the houses, I espied the ditch on my left hand, and the bank
whereon stood the Wall: the common road goes all the way on its north
side. I followed it for two miles up the hill by Eswic, going along the
road side as before. Many shafts of the coal-mines are sunk upon it.
When we are got into the closes, the foot-way goes along that called
Adrian’s ditch; both bank and ditch plainly visible, the bank north.
It runs parallel to the Wall, but upon the declining ground south, as
the other north: this confirms me in my suspicion, that both works
were made at the same time, and by the same persons, and with intent
that this should be a counter-guard to the other, the whole included
space being military ground. When arrived at the highest ground, is
Benwell hill, a military work, one of the larger _castra_; being 400
foot along the wall, i. e. east and west; not quite so much north and
south, 350: this is intrenched with a foss, and had a stone wall, the
vestiges whereof are sufficiently distinguishable; as also great tracks
of buildings within it, as at the others. It commands a great prospect
every way: I doubt not but they could see hence to the next _castrum_
westward; to the east, over Newcastle to the late-mentioned little
fort beyond Euxborn; so to Baker-mill hill: southward is a most
delightful prospect up two fine valleys over the Tyne; so up the hills
south of _Gabrocentum_, or Gateshead: the eye reaches too the sea-coast
to _Tunnocelum_, or Tynmouth, and the mouth of the river. The village
of Benwell subjacent was built out of the ruins of this place, and
great quantity of stone is still left. I saw much fragments of Roman
bricks, pavings, and gutter-tiles. Two urns were dug up near here; sent
to Durham college. I transcribed some altars too, found in this place,
at Mr. Shaftoe’s of Benwell tower.

It was a refined piece of management, and great knowledge of things,
the Romans showed in the method of this wall; and a matter worthy of
remark, that they chose all along to raise this work on the north
side of the two rivers, that partly cross the island hereabouts,
the Eden and Tyne. Many are apt to wonder at it, and think it was
injudicious, imagining the rivers, with a very slender work on the
south side of them, would have been sufficient security, and saved
them much labour: but, if we consider this matter, we must confess
it was not done without great consideration, and a master-stroke of
military policy; for by this means the Romans took in all the fine rich
ground lying upon the rivers for the sustentation of their troops,
encouraged thereby to cultivate it, and build towns near, and make
possessions to themselves and families, that they might live easy, and
think themselves at home in these distant regions: here too trade and
navigation might be carried on, and supplies of corn, wood, and other
materials, conveyed from garrison to garrison; and in the times of the
perfection of this work it must be looked upon as the best planted spot
of ground in the island: and we may imagine the glorious show of towns,
cities, castles, temples, and the like, on the south side of this Wall,
by contemplating the prodigious quantities of their ruins and memorials
beyond that of any other part of Europe, scarce excepting imperial
Rome: and we have reason to think _this_ will continue to be a source
of entertainment for the curious and learned, when _that_ is exhausted.
Hither let the young noblemen and gentry travel, to admire the wonders
of their native country, thick sown by that great, wise and industrious
people, and learn with them how to value it.

Cæsar tells us the warlike nation of the Germans, the _Suevi_, gloried
most in laying waste all the bordering countries around them, in
destroying every thing that might administer sustenance to an enemy
in approaching to their quarters. It was certainly equally political
in the Romans to leave on the north side of the Wall that huge tract
of waterless and dismal moor, a great barren solitude, where in some
places you may walk sixty miles endwise without meeting with a house,
or a tree: to ride it is impracticable. Thus, as much as in them lay,
without the horror of barbarity did they remove the barbarians from
their territories; whilst within the Wall, either naturally or by their
industry, all things smiled like the garden of Eden: and indeed, toward
both sea-coasts, about Carlisle and Newcastle, it is a very desirable
and delightful country: and even in the midland moory tracts, by their
great roads made every where, it was very good travelling; and in the
worst parts, where their _castra_ stood, and upon the valleys, it is
now tolerably good, and was much better in their days, in the hands of
those who could almost conquer Nature herself.

One of the Benwell inscriptions is plainly to be filled up at top thus;
_Jovi O. M. Dolicheno & numinibus Aug._ Mr. Gale says, there is an
inscription in Gruter, with _Jovi Dolicheno ubi ferrum nascitur_: there
is another inscription, to _Jovi Dolicheno_, found in Wales: whence he
infers with verisimilitude, that Dolichenus signifies not a topical
deity; rather, some that presided over iron-works: but I cannot imagine
what language it is. In the town I found three more inscriptions,
though endeavoured to be concealed from me with a rudeness I never met
before, even among the most unbred rustics. The fort at Benwell hill
goes north of the road too, with an equal bulk; so that the Wall takes
a circuit northward to inviron it: it is full of ruins too; so that it
was really a city, induced probably by the extreme pleasantness of the
place. A well was lately filled up there.

I find very plainly that the Picts wall, east of the town, came from
Red Barns all along the street, so to Pandon gate, there being a great
declivity, and a brook running without: then it crossed the valley
within the town, where the brook runs, and went up the next hill to
All-Saints church, which no doubt stands upon the Wall, out of which
it was built: here is still a descent, where Silver-street is; and
northward then it went directly to the lane called Panter-haugh,
(probably from the old name, _Panna_, corrupted) with a descent still
northward; so to the brow of the hill where the castle stands: here
it met the Wall coming from West gate; and no doubt the site of the
present castle was the ancient _Panna_, and this castle was built
out of the ruins of the old one, and the adjacent parts of the Wall
together. I suspect much, that a piece of the outer wall of the present
castle, which stands on the west side in a tattered condition, may
be Roman, at least built with Roman stone: this going upon the slope
of the hill, the courses of the stone slope too, parallel with the
declivity: but, be that as it will, at the foundation of it, a little
lower, I saw a bit of the true old Roman wall, and indubitably so, made
of white lime-stone, with mortar prodigiously hard, and ringing like a
bell when struck upon. This castle has a great precipice eastward over
Sand hill, and southward toward the river.

In the fields eastward, between Pandon gate and Red Barns, the
counter-guard as I call that (vulgarly Adrian’s _vallum_) is plain,
running all along parallel to the Wall; which method it observes where
the ground leaves it that liberty. I suppose the city that belonged to
this castle of _Panna_ lay about Sand hill, at the end of the ferry.
The south-west part of the town-wall to the postern was built on the
counter-guard of that side. This town stands on three lingulas sloping
toward the river. Probably William Rufus rebuilt this castle too, as
that at Carlisle, and with the same purpose, as a guard against the
pillaging Scots.

The manner of conveying the coals down to the river side from the
pits, is very ingenious: a cart-way is made by a frame of timber, on
which the wheels of the carts run without horses, with great celerity;
so that they are forced to moderate their descent by a piece of wood
like a lever applied to one of the wheels. The manner of rowing their
great barges here is also very particular, and not unworthy of remark:
four men manage the whole; three to a great and long oar, that push
it forward; and one to another such a-stern, that assists the other
motion, but at the same time steers the keel, and corrects the biass
the other gives it. They observe that horses kept under ground in the
coal-mines for two or three years, as sometimes they do, have their
hair very fine and sleek, and as short almost as that of a mouse. We
saw Col. Lyddal’s coal-works at Tanfield, where he carries the road
over valleys filled up with earth, 100 foot high, 300 foot broad at
bottom: other valleys as large have a stone bridge laid across: in
other places hills are cut through for half a mile together; and in
this manner a road is made, and frames of timber laid, for five miles,
to the river side, where coals were delivered at 5_s._ the chaldron.

We were conducted down the river, by the officers of the customs,
to North Sheels, at the mouth of the river, the _Tunnocelum_ of the
Romans. This is a very pleasant open river, and broad: sometimes 300 or
400 sail of ships lie here. Tinmouth castle, no doubt, was the Roman
castle, standing high on the northern promontory. Clifford’s fort is a
small insignificant fort upon the edge of the water. The shore of the
river for the most part is rocky, and in some places pleasantly covered
with wood. We saw Tarrow to the southward, famous for the birth-place
of the most learned monk, venerable Bede.

Some of the coal-works here dip full East: it is plain south-east is
the natural dip in general; those at Whitehaven, inclining south-west,
I suppose receive a counter-bias, as being on the west side of the
island. Sometimes they set green poles of alder and the like within
the works, to support a weak part of the rock over-head; and then
it is observed the juices in the tree will work upwards, and spread
themselves upon the rock in a branch-like efflorescence.

Ravensworth castle was moated about, and castellated; but I could hear
of no Roman antiquities found there. It stands under a very pleasant
wood, and in a fine vale extending itself into Yorkshire, as they say,
and farther; perhaps through the whole kingdom. Above this house to the
west, upon the top of the fell, toward Tanfield is a most extensive
prospect, over a great part of the Roman wall; so to the Cheviot
hills toward Scotland, to Tinmouth castle, the sea, Lumley castle,
and quite round; that it is very probable somewhere hereabouts was a
Roman castle, and this might be the _Ravonia_ Mr. Baxter places at
Ravensworth.

The fund of coal in this country is inexhaustible; for the whole
country is a mine of coal quite across the kingdom, in the moors, and
so to Scotland: and this will be an eternal source of seamen in the
kingdom. Going up the hill toward Benwell, I find the counter-guard
goes just 300 foot off the wall, which was sufficient for the march
of the detachments from place to place. The eastward part of the wall
joined the castle where the stairs now are. A good part of the friery
is standing, being a court: the chapel is converted into a hall for the
smiths. Nothing of the nunnery left, but the jambs of the gate-house
next the street.


                              GABROCENTVM

Was Gateshead, as its name imports in British, I suppose, from the
sign of some inn: a Goat still stands upon a sign of the Golden
Lion, crowned. I guess this was a fortified town in the times of the
Romans, where a ferry was for passage northward; but by reason of the
buildings no traces of it are left: it stands on a deep rocky descent
Westward. The Roman road here, which is the true Hermen-street coming
from Sussex, coming down Gateshead fell, passes in a strait line to
the bridge. I saw several Roman stones here, the recipient part of
their hand-mills. In this place, in the time of the _Notitia_, lay the
second cohort of the Thracians in garrison. There is an odd _mausoleum_
in the church-yard.

Lord Hertford’s workmen, digging up the Roman city by Marlborough,
found a piece of brass with an inscription in Romano-barbarous
letters, a quarter of an inch high, thus: ʌ.MʌIS.ʌBALLʌVʌ.
VXELODVM.CʌMBOGLʌNS.BʌNNʌ; which I interpreted, being the names of
five Roman stations: it was upon the edge of a cup. The castle at
Newcastle was built by Robert son of William I. after his return from
the expedition against Malcolm king of Scots.

Lumley castle has a fine appearance hence. The Hermen-street is very
plain, being in a strait line hither when we descend from Gateshead
fell. I think Bede mentions this station, as called _Concester_, which
retains part of the Roman name. Great coal-works too hereabouts. The
first wing of the _Astures_ made this their garrison, as the _Notitia_
tells us, being _ad lineam valli_; for, though it be not upon the
Wall, it is reasonable to think his expression is not to be strictly
taken: it was convenient that some of the forces that guarded the wall
should be quartered at some suitable distance, that they might have
room of country for their maintenance. Here was a collegiate church
founded by Anthony Bec, bishop of Durham; and here lived the Lindisfarn
bishops, with the celebrated body of St. Cuthbert, before they settled
at Durham. At Lumley castle is a curious old picture of Chaucer, said
to be an original. Egelric monk of Peterborough, after bishop, built
a church here in the time of William I. in digging the foundation he
found an infinite deal of money, (Roman, I suppose,) with which he
repaired the church at Burgh, and made a causeway through the fens
between Spalding and Deeping.


                                DURHAM,

Extremely well seated in a bend of the Vedra. The neck of the
peninsula is guarded by a strong castle, with a great tower upon a
keep, or mount: it is now the bishop’s palace: all beyond that is the
abbey-ground. The city lies before the castle, and on both sides the
river: this being very high ground, the back side of every street
has gardens, with a fine prospect over the river. It would be very
strange if the Romans missed so fine and strong a situation, so near
the great road; yet I do not hear of any antiquities found here: but
eastward over the river, upon another peninsula of high ground, I saw
a camp, called Maidencastle, which I judge to be theirs: it is almost
incompassed too by a rivulet falling into the river from the east:
it is of an oblong form, 500 foot long, very steep on three sides;
the neck is guarded by a rampart, and without that, at some little
distance, with a ditch. The prospect is large, more especially eastward.

[Sidenote: TAB. LXXIV.]

The church antiquities of this place are capable of a large history,
if pursued thoroughly by a judicious hand: it would give one a good
idea of the ancient manner and magnificence of our great abbeys: there
are no where such remains of that kind left among us. The revenues
hereof are very great; which enables them to keep every thing in good
repair, and to live very splendidly: indeed the whole city is supported
only by the church. The cathedral is a very large and majestic
pile, of the Saxon manner of building intirely, and all of a piece,
except the east end transept and middle tower, and some later windows
of mullion-work put into the old frames. I call that the Saxon manner
which was in use among us at the time of the Conquest; being somewhat
Roman degenerate, with semicircular windows, and arches, and great
round pillars; the walls very thick, without buttresses: these, I
suppose, together with pointed arches, slender pillars, and the like,
which we call the Gothic, came from France. Very few monuments are left
here: one of a bishop, under the bishop’s throne: in the choir the
largest one, of a bishop, I ever saw; it is upon the ground, composed
of two huge flat stones: the brass of it, which was proportional, is
pulled off. Here are many of the ancient original copes, very richly
embroidered, in which they officiate at the sacrament service; a custom
here only preserved. The screen at the high altar is of stone, with
pinacle work, somewhat like that at St. Alban’s; with many niches for
images: behind is the stone under which lies the body of St. Cuthbert,
and upon which stood his shrine. The eastern wall of the church is one
intire transept, as long as the cross transept (I think,) and called
the Nine Altars, from so many there placed. Much painted glass of
saints, &c. Two images, among others left, are those of St. Cuthbert,
and venerable Bede. The dome under the middle tower is very high, with
a handsome balustrade of ancient manner within side. At the west end,
built upon a high wall from the edge of the river, is a place called
the Galilee, consisting of five ailes supported with handsome pillars:
the use of it, and the meaning of the name, I know not; but the
middlemost seems to have been an oratory, to pray for the soul of the
founder of it, whose tomb stands at the east end: his arms are, _Palé_
of ten, a mullet for difference. Near it, under a plain black tomb,
lies the great Bede, the light of learning in darkest times; the first
and the last among the monks. The cloisters are large and handsome;
so is the chapter-house. The dean’s lodging is that of the prior’s;
for the most part preserved in its primitive state; the hall, the
parlour, large and stately; the prior’s lodging-room well cieled, and
roofed with Irish oak, which Mr. Gale conjectures as old as Richard the
Second’s time, by the chained white-harts carved therein: the prior’s
kitchen is intire; a curious piece of geometry in stone, and vies with
that of the abbot of Glastonbury; octagonal, with square outlets at the
corners. The prebend’s houses are all very good. A large and handsome
library, founded by dean Subden; his picture at full length at the end
of it. Here is an excellent and large collection of old manuscripts;
a very fine Latin Bible in three volumes; a psaltery wrote by Bede; a
collection of Roman and others coins. Sir George Wheeler, a prebend
here, gave his intire collection of Greek and other coins, which he
collected in his travels; together with some natural curiosities,
particularly the impressions of fishes, and other antediluvian matters,
upon slate. Here are a great many Roman altars, inscriptions, _basso
relievo_’s, &c. belonging to our own country; which they got from about
the Picts Wall, Lanchester, &c. We were particularly favoured with
a sight of the treasury as called, being a very numerous repository
of the charters, bulls, _inspeximus_’s, and muniments, belonging to
the church, from the kings of England, Scotland, popes, bishops, &c.
digested into lockers: among others, an original _Magna Charta_. We saw
likewise the old dormitory of the monks.

In the minster-yard are some monumental stones of knights, and a lady
on the ground, with others of flower-work: among them I saw a Roman
altar set for a grave-stone, but no inscription left. Likewise Dr.
Hunter showed me a Roman head in a garden-wall: if I be not mistaken,
it is of Marcus Aurelius. The doctor has a great collection of
antiquities. On a coral-coloured _patera_ the potter’s mark, AMANDVS:
many of these vessels curiously wrought with lions, flowers, &c. found
at Binchester, _Vinovium_: the clay is there met withall, and there was
a great pottery. He showed us a pretty onyx, found at Piercebridge: I
think it is Psyche. He says there was an aqueduct at Lanchester: many
inscriptions broke there, just before he went. He has a recipient celt,
found with some others, and an odd piece of cast brass, at Weremouth
near Sunderland, by the sea-side: the edge of the celt is turned up at
both ends, and confirms my notion of the use of them, being designed
for no great force: it is three inches and a half long, pretty much
worn, but sharp yet.

There was a Roman city at Pierce bridge: remains of the castle-ditch.
Cunscliff, a mile off, was the place they had their stone from; and
there the inscription was found; whence some would fix _Condate_ at
this place, though it is plainly _Dis Manibus Condati_, &c. and refers
to a man, not a city. There is an old chapel on the bridge. They call
the Roman road here the Watling-street. A brass _Jupiter fulminans_,
and a _genius alatus_, found at Lanchester, at Dr. Hunter’s. A golden
inscription to Hercules, in the library at Durham.

From Pierce bridge we entered immediately upon the Roman road, which
comes to the river a little lower down than the present bridge: it is a
broad, very strait, and hard road at this day; the great ridge of stone
originally laid, being not worn out through so many ages, though broken
and in great need of reparation. Several mile-stones by the way. Upon
a moor we saw a branch run from it north-west, which goes to Bowes,
_Lavatræ_, and other stations towards Carlisle.


                      CATARACTONIVM. +Catteric.+

Brough, on the south banks of the Swale, was a castle: much Roman
coins and antiquities found thereabouts. The town Catteric, which so
evidently retains the name, is a mile off.

    ——_sic toties versa est fortuna locorum._      +Ovid.+ Met.

Thornborough, the old city, stands a little above the bridge and
road: it is a farm-house only, on a high ground, and on the edge of
the river, being steep. Foundations of the old walls left, and much
antiquity dug up.

The Hermen-street continues southward by the British name of
_Leming-lane_, all composed of stone, and paved with large coggles,
which the neighbouring inhabitants take away to build withal, and pave
their yards, &c. This is a ridge of ground that was originally down:
on both sides lie the most delightful plains of Yorkshire, bounded by
distant hills both ways: it is a rich country, admirably watered, and
well planted with wood, thronged with towns, and Roman antiquities; for
that people knew how to set a just value on it. Mr. Gale showed me,
at his pleasant seat of Scruton, his admirable library, where are no
fewer than 430 choice manuscripts, collected by his father, many finely
illuminated; many ancient classics of great value; a _Priscian_, wrote
by a disciple of his.


                       ISVRIVM. +Boroughbridge.+

We travelled along the Roman road, strait and perfect, till we turned
out to Rippon. The market-place is a square, spacious enough: in the
middle of it an obelisk is erected: had it been of large stones, of a
good kind, and of a good proportion, it would have been a real ornament
to the place. The cathedral here is a large strong building, handsome
enough: there is an entrance from the west part of the great tower
within, to go under ground, exactly like that we saw at Hexham, and
made for the same intent: here is a chapel to St. Wilfrid, where I
suppose his bones lie; and a place called his Needle, a passage the
vulgar amuse themselves with. Hence we went by Newby, a new seat of Sir
Edward Blackett’s, in a rich country. So we fell into the Roman road
again at Boroughbridge. We visited Aldborough, a mile off, the _Isurium
Brigantum_. Here was a great city walled about: the church and present
town, which is a borough by prescription, is inclosed within it. We
saw the foundation of the Wall, where they have long been digging it
up, as the common quarry for stone, when they want it: it was curious
to observe their method of laying the foundation of it in clay: above
that the stones are laid in mortar. This same manner I found used
at the Picts wall, where I saw the foundation of it, by Chester. We
saw and heard of many antiquities at this place: coins of Antoninus,
Constantine, Tetricus, and many more; some of which I purchased:
intaglia’s are very frequent here; for such, together with coins, are
commonly taken up after rain; and the people customarily look for them
as they walk through the town. There has been some very great building
in the street before the church; for many stones were taken up there,
many remain. We saw some at the church-yard gate, and at people’s
doors; among which, two pieces of pillars; the _hypotrachelion_ on one;
and several foundations of a gate, in which were the iron hinges. I
saw the stones; they were of a large size. Many square stones, with a
square hole in the middle, lie at the ale-house door over-against the
church, all manifestly of a Roman cut; and the whole town abounds with
them. The man at the ale-house says the earth all about is exceeding
rich, quite black, is never manured; that coins rusted together are
found perpetually, and pavements, &c. In his sisters house, west of
the church, we were highly delighted with a great part of a Mosaic
pavement, perfectly preserved, and covered with a roof: the remainder
is now under the causeway of the street: it was laid with stones, red,
blue, and white, of excellent colour: some part is also under the
adjacent barn-floor. The late Rev. Mr. Morris, minister here, collected
much: Mr. Wilkinson, the duke of Newcastle’s steward, collects now.
Slates are sometimes ploughed up, (none such near;) many silver coins,
some of which were bought by Sir James Dalrymple. In the church wall
are many Gothic remains of basso relievo’s, figures of animals, much
like lord Winchelsea’s Sark antiquities. A figure of Pan in the
vestry-wall of Aldborough: an intagliate cornelian was found there; an
eagle, a _signum militare_, a _cornucopia_ cut on it.

Rippon monastery was founded by Wilfrid, the Saxon bishop, about anno
Dom. 670, the same who founded St. Leonard’s priory by Stamford; and
likewise that at Hexam, which afterwards became a bishoprick. Wilfrid
died at Oundle, and was buried at Rippon.

[Sidenote: TAB. XC.]

The stones, as much famed by the name of the Devil’s Arrows, as
misrepresented by writers, stand in some fields, half a mile west
of the Roman road south of Boroughbridge. Some think them Roman,
though they regard not any Roman work hereabouts: some say they are
factitious, though plain stone as possible. They are stones of very
large dimensions, and have been hewn pretty square, much as those at
Stonehenge; but silly people have knocked off the edges: their height
is very great: they were very taper and well-shaped, and much of an
obelisk form; but the tops are decayed, and long furrows worn down
on all sides along the tenderest part of the grain of the stone. I
remarked, that they all lean somewhat southward. The stone is entirely
composed of small white crystals, unperishable by weather: they are
certainly natural, and brought about ten miles off, from the west,
where more such lie above ground in great plenty. Three now stand; one
was taken away, as all report, to make a bridge over the bec a little
eastward. The cross near the church is of the same stone. These stones
stood 200 foot asunder, pretty near in a line north and south: the
first stone westward is not so high as the other, but broader much,
and stands square, or perpendicular to the line of direction; it is 8½
foot broad, 4½ thick, 23 foot about: the second in the next pasture is
square each side, but not precisely; it is 5 foot broad, 4 foot thick,
18 foot square: the next is twice as far distant, and beyond the road,
of a figure much like the former, but rather higher, as that is higher
than the first; this is 5 foot by 4: the two last are very beautiful
obelisks, and their height about 25 foot, as I guess. The ground this
fine monument stands on is high, and declines every way a little from
it: the great river, the brook, and some low ground to the south, hem
it in as it were. Mr. Gale, and the beforementioned clergyman, some
time since dug under one to the foundation, and found that it was about
five foot under ground, and fastened into its seat by stones laid in
clay, quite around it, as a wall: they put four half-pence, in a leaden
box underneath, of queen _Anne_, _Vigo_, &c. and filled it up again.
I could not commend them for it, as it could only tend to mislead the
curious of future times.

[Sidenote: TAB. XCVIII.]

We went upon a Roman way till we came to the river Nidd, half-way
to York, where moor begins. At Ackham we saw the hill called Severs
hill, with much reason thought to be that on which was performed
the consecration of Severus the emperor; and, no doubt, with great
magnificence: it is a large round hill, and the highest ground near
York, about two miles distance from it: there seemed to be a long
barrow west of it. York is a very large city, but old, and narrow
streets. I saw the multangular tower in the city-wall, just by St.
Mary’s abbey, which was built by the Romans, as to the bottom part: the
upper has been added; it was originally of twelve sides: the stones
are of squared faces, four Roman inches high; the inside, rubble, and
excessive hard mortar: it seems within side as if a seat had been
carried round it: three of the sides are gone: it is on the west side
of the city. I went to see the two statues on St. Laurence church-wall,
thought to be Roman; but they are not so: they are monumental
tomb-stones of founders of churches laid just above ground somewhere,
and removed hither: they are very ancient; I believe, about king John’s
time. The cathedral here is a noble building; but, except that the
side-walks are somewhat broader, and are carried on the west side of
the transepts, it is exceeded in every thing by Lincoln minster; as,
for instance, in the manner of approach on the west, in the front for
breadth and height, in the stone roof, the towers, the cloisters, and
in general the magnificence of the whole: the chapter-house here is
only vaulted with wainscot; that at Lincoln with stone. The river Ouse
divides the city in two. The walls on the west side are in good repair,
and may be walked round. All the walls here are low, but built upon
a huge _agger_ of earth; I suppose, the Roman manner. There are two
figures of Ulphus’s horn in the cathedral. In the west end of the
steeple of St. Martin’s church, Micklegate, is the remnant of a fine
funeral monument, Roman; a man and his wife, with their son, a child,
in their habits: near it a piece of flower-work, perhaps belonging
to the frize of some magnificent building. There are twenty four
parish-churches here. The bridge over the Ouse, commonly magnified
to strangers, is a very ordinary thing, and exceeded by most of the
bridges in the county.

Of Severus thus writes Herodian III. Antoninus, and Geta his brother,
governed the empire jointly: they sailed from Britain, and went to Rome
with their father’s reliques; for his body being burnt, they carried
thither his ashes, put into an alabaster urn with gums and sweets, that
they might be reposed in the sacred monuments of the princes.

There were two reasons why the Roman Emperors residing here chose to
make York their imperial seat. 1. Because of its vicinity to the Scotch
frontiers, where they were perpetually upon their guard upon the Wall
against their incursions. 2. Because it is in a fruitful country,
upon a navigable river; but more because they could bring hither corn
from the southern countries of Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire,
Cambridgeshire, &c. all the way by water carriage, from the river Ouse
or Nen at Peterborough, up the Cardike, the Witham to Lincoln, the
Fossdike (undoubtedly a work of theirs) the Trent, across the Humber,
up the Ouse to York; a particular not yet taken notice of. The old arch
in the bar leading to Micklegate is said to be Roman.


                        CALCARIA. +Tadcaster.+

We still kept on the Roman road all the way hither. A great sconce a
little way off York, called the Mount, consisting of four bastions
raised in the civil wars. It is a most delicious country, overflowing
with plenty. The Roman _castrum_ here is now called the Castle-field;
it was square, about 400 foot, and had walls round: it stands north of
the town, near the church and river: its ground within, and rampires
are high; but it must be understood withall, that the place has been
altered, and made into a castle of later form, with a keep or mount.
I heard of coins being found here; but at Newton Kyme, a mile off,
vast quantities of antiquities are discovered. The castle at Tadcaster
is called Kelkbar; a remnant of the ancient name. This country is a
lime-stone quarry, and, by reason of its convenient rivers, was a
trading place in that commodity in the time of the Romans; whence its
name. Many barrows are to be seen hereabouts, for I suppose it was
formerly a down.


                       LEGEOLIVM. +Castleford.+

Here the Hermen-street passes the river Aire, remarkable for its smooth
face and gentle current: it is broad and deep withall; navigable
hither: thus the river Arar, synonymous in Gaul. The place where the
Roman ford was, is a little above the cascade: the stones are in
great part left, but the mill-dam lays it too deep under water. Hence
the paved road goes up the bank to the east side of the church, and
forward through the fields, where innumerable coins are ploughed up:
one part is called Stone-acre. A man told us he had formerly ploughed
up a dozen Roman coins in a day: urns are often found: there are stone
pavements, foundations, &c. South of the church is a pasture, called
Castle garth: here were buildings of the city; but the Roman _castrum_
was where the church now stands, built probably out of its ruins: it is
very high ground, and included the parsonage-house, gardens, &c. the
low ground of the ditch that incompassed it is manifest. The country
people have a notion of its being an old city, and of the Roman road
crossing the meadows by this ford; and of great seats and palaces
having been here formerly. Here is a sweet meadow, north of the river,
of great extent. There is a ditch a little west of the old castle,
which I take to be some later work. Great coal-works here. The Romans
ran the Hermen-street through this country as much to the west as they
reasonably could, to obtain fords over the numerous rivers; because
they avoided ferries and bridges, as troublesome, and wanting frequent
reparation. Much dane-weed, or wild elder, grows here.


                          DANVM. +Doncaster.+

Just before we came to Robin Hood’s well, we met the Hermen-street
with a very high and perfect ridge coming from Castle-ford; it bears
north-west and south-east precisely: presently after, it makes an
angle, and goes southward. Robin Hood’s well stands upon the road in
a valley: there is a new cover made to it lately by Sir John Vanbrug.
Then the Roman road leaves us on the right a little, till at Doncaster
town-end. At the marsh-gate is an old chapel and a cross of stone,
triangular, with three niches. Doncaster church and steeple is large
and beautiful: at the east end is an old chapel, now converted to
secular uses. Near the market-place another older chapel, of St.
Magdalen, which the corporation use for their place of assembly. I
believe the Roman _castrum_ was by the river side, where the church and
parsonage-house stand. Coming out of the town is another cross upon the
road, where they fable a Roman emperor was buried. The Roman road a
little farther is very apparent, going over a fine heath, so to Bawtry,
upon the river Idle, slowly conducting its waters through a large level
moor to the Humber. Probably here was a camp formerly. They have some
trade here in lead from Derbyshire, mill-stones, and Roch-abbey stone
of a good kind. Hither comes the Hermen-street, which I call the new
branch, from _Agelocum_. We passed over a deep valley at Went, beyond
Robin Hood’s well: the northern precipice of it is rocky, as that of
Gateshead.

Having brought this journal to the edge of Nottinghamshire and
Lincolnshire, of which parts I gave my observations in former _Iters_,
I conclude this with the following reflections. The amazing scene of
Roman grandeur in Britain which I beheld this journey, the more it
occurred with pleasure to my own imagination, the more I despaired
of conveying it to the reader in a proper light by a rehearsal. It
is easy for some nations to magnify trifles, and in words gild over
inconsiderable transactions till they swell to the appearance of an
history; and some moderns have gone great lengths that way: but if
in any people action has outdone the capacity of rhetoric, or in any
place they have left historians far behind in their valour and military
performances, it was in our own country; and we are as much surprised
in finding such infinite reliques of theirs here, as that we have no
history of them that speaks with any particularity of the last 300
years that the Romans dwelt in Britain, and rendered it perfectly
provincial. The learned memoirs are very short; and it is well they
were guided with such a spirit, as left monuments sufficient to supply
that defect, when handled as they deserve: though I have no hope of
coming up to that, yet I hold myself obliged to preserve, as well
as I can, the memory of such things as I saw; which, added to what
future times will discover, will revive the Roman glory among us,
and may serve to invite noble minds to endeavour at that merit and
public-spiritedness which shine through all their actions. This tribute
at least we owe them, and they deserve it at our hands, to preserve
their remains.

Finis erat orbis ora Gallici littoris, nisi Brittania insula,
non qualibet amplitudine, nomen pene _orbis alterius_ mereretur.
octingentis enim & amplius millibus passuum longa porrigitur: ita ut
eam in Caledonicum usque promuntorium metiamur.

II. Veteres Britanniam, ab albis rupibus, primùm +Albionem+, postea,
vocabulo gentis suæ, BRITTANIAM cognominaverunt, cum BRITTANICÆ
vocarentur omnes, de quibus mox paulò dicemus.

III. Inter Septemtriones & occidentem locata est, Germanice, Galliæ,
Hispaniæ, maxumis Europæ partibus magno intervallo adversa, oceano
Athlantico clauditur.

IV. Habet ipsa Brittania à meridie Galliam Belgicam, cujus proximum
littus transmeantibus civitas aperit, quæ Rhutupis portus dicitur, hic
abest à Gessoriaco Morinorum, Brittanicæ gentis portu, trajectu millium
L. sive, ut quidam scripsere, stadiorum CCCCL. illinc conspiciuntur
BRITTONES quos

    ——_penitus toto divisos orbe_——

canit Virgilius Maro in Eclogis.

V. Agrippa, vetus orbis descriptor, latitudinem ejus CCC. m. p. credit.
Beda verò rectiùs CC. exceptis duntaxat prolixioribus diversorum
promuntoriorum tractibus quibus efficitur ut circuitus ejus quadragies
octies septuaginta quinque millia passuum compleat. Marcianus author
Græcus mecum +mdiↄↄlxxv.+ milliaria habet.


                               CAPUT II.

Albion, quæ Brittania Magna à Chrysosthomo authore Græco dicitur,
natura, ut refert Cæsar, triquetra & Siciliæ maxume similis est, cujus
unum latus est contra Galliam Celticam, hujus lateris alter angulus,
qui est ad Cantium, ad orientem solem; inferior, qui est ad Ocrinum
promuntorium apud Damnonos, ad meridiem & Hispaniam Tarroconensem
spectat. hoc latus tenet circiter millia passuum D.

II. Alterum latus vergit ad Hiberniam & occidentem solem, hujus est
longitudo lateris, ut fert Veterum opinio, DCC. m. p.

III. Tertium est contra Septemtriones cui parti nulla est objecta
terra, præter insulas; sed ejus angulus lateris maxumè ad Germaniam
Magnam spectat, huic à Novanto chersoneso per Taixalorum regionis
angulum Cantium promuntorium usque millia passuum DCCC. in longitudinem
esse existimatur. Ita omnes insulam computabant in circuitu vicies
centena millia passuum, sed errant, nam à Cantio Ocrinum usque m. p.
est distantia CCCC. inde Novantum M. deinde Cantium MMCC. totusi insulæ
circuitus, ut supra, MMMCCCCCC. millia passuum est.

IV. Formam totius Brittaniæ Livius & Fabius Rusticus, veterum
doctissimi authores. oblongæ scutulæ vel bipenni assimilavere, &
ut annalium conditor Tacitus, est ea facies citra Caledoniam, unde
& in universam fama est transgressa; sed immensum & enorme spatium
procurrentium extremo jam littore terrarum, velut in cuneum tenuatur,
sed Cæsar, inclutissimus Dictator, cum Mela Romanorum nobili scriptore,
pluribus eam triquetræ dixere similem. de quo supra.

V. Si Ptolemæo, orbis terrarum descriptori egregio, aliisque, coævis
illi scriptoribus habenda fides, litteram Z, sed inversam, repræsentat
hæc insula, nec tamen ex omni parte exacte quadrare hoc simile
sufficienter præbet recentiori ævo descriptarum mapparum inspectio.
Triquetra tamen figura soli Angliæ quodammodo videtur conveniens.


                              CAPUT III.

Cæterum Brittaniam qui mortales initio coluerint, indigenæ an advecti,
ut inter nationes cæteras, parum compertum. Solis quippe Judæis, &
per ipsos finitimis quibusdam gentibus, hoc contigit felicitatis,
ut à primo inde mundi exordio gentis suæ originem continua serie ex
infallibilibus deducere possint monumentis.

II. Habitus corporum varii, atque ex eo argumenta. namque rutulæ
Caledoniam habitantium comæ, magni artus, Germanicam originem
asseverant; Silurum colorati vultus, & torti plerumque crines, & positu
contra Hispaniam, ut author est Tacitus, Iberos veteres trajecisse,
easque & in Hybernia sedes occupasse fidem faciunt. Proximi Gallis &
similes sunt, seu durante originis vi, seu procurrentibus in diversa
terris, positio cœlo corporibus habitum dedit.

III. Heic, si luberet indulgere fabulis, notare possem Venetos ope
commercii navalis incolas religionesque his terris primùm intulisse,
imò non desunt scriptores qui Herculem huc quoque pervenisse, regnumque
constituisse, referunt; his verò tam altè reconditis antiquitatibus,
fabulis hinc inde refertis, immorari vix operæ pretium videtur.

IV. In universum tamen estimanti, Gallos vicinum solum occupasse
credibile est. eorum sacra deprehendas, superstitionum, ait Tacitus,
persuasionem. sermo haud multum diversus. pro ulteriori signo inservit
Druidum traditio, unà cum nominibus civitatum, quæ verò omnes iis
nominibus appellabantur, quibus gentes, ortæ ex Galliæ civitatibus, quæ
eò pervenerunt, atque agros colere ceperunt.

V. Hominum est, inquit Cæsar, infinita multitudo, creberrimàque
ædificia, ferè Gallicis consimilia, pecora sine numero.

VI. Omnium tamen humanissimi, qui Brittaniam austrinam incolebant,
neque multum à Gallis differebant consuetudine; ulteriores plerique
frumenta non serebant, sed lacte, fructu & carne vivebant, lanæ iis
usus ac vestium ignotus erat, & quanquam continuis frigoribus utebantur
pellibus, tamen cervinis aut ovinis vestiti erant, & lavabantur in
fluminibus.

VII. Omnes verò se Brittones olim vitro infecerunt, quod cœruleum
efficit colorem, atque, refert Cæsar, hoc horribiliore sunt in pugna
adspectu. capilloque sunt, ut ait Romanorum Dux, promisso, atque omni
parte corporis rasa præter caput & labrum superius.

VIII. Uxores habebant Brittones deni duodenique inter se communes,
& maxume fratres cum fratribus, parentes cum liberis; sed, si qui
erant ex his nati, eorum habebantur liberi, à quibus primùm virgines
quæque ductæ erant. sua quemque mater uberibus alit, nec ancillis, nec
nutricibus delectantur.

IX. Utebantur aut nummo æreo, aut annulis ferreis, ad certum pondus
examinatis, pro nummis, ut author est Cæsar Dictator.

X. Leporem & gallinam & anserem gustare Brittones fas non putabant, hæc
tamen alebant animi voluptatisque causa.

XI. Erant autem margaritæ, frena heburnea, & armillæ, & electrina atque
vitrea vasa, & gagates lapides, &, quod cæteris excellit, stannum,
magna copia merces.

XII. Utebantur & navibus, quarum carinæ primùm ac statumina ex levi
materia fiebant, reliquum corpus navium ambitus viminibus contextus
coriis bubulorum integebatur. quantocunque tempore cursus tenebant, ut
author est Solinus, navigantes, escis abstinent.


                      De +Re Militari+ Brittonum.

XIII. Fert ipsa Brittania populos Regesque populorum, ut Mela lib. III.
scripsit, sed sunt inculti omnes, atque ut longiùs à continenti absunt,
ita aliarum opum ignari, magis tantum pecore ac finibus dites; causas
autem & bella contrahunt, ac se frequenter invicem infestant. maxume
imperitandi cupidine studioque ea prolatandi, quæ possident. solitum
quidem, Brittones fœminarum ductu bellasse, neque sexum in imperiis
discrevisse.

XIV. Dimicabant Brittones non solum equitatus peditatusque modo, sed
etiam bigis et curribus, Gallicè armati, covinos, essedas verò more
vulgari, vocabant, quorum falcatis axibus utebantur.

XV. Equitum genus est, iis, quum est usus, atque aliquod bellum
incidit, ut Cæsar est author, quod antè Romanorum adventum ferè
quotannis accidere solebat, uti aut ipsi injurias inferrent, aut
illatas propulsarent. omnes in bello versantur, atqui eorum, ut quisque
est genere copiisque amplissimus, ita plurimos circum se ambactos
clientesque habet. hanc unam gratiam potentiamque noverunt.

XVI. In pedite erat Brittonum robur, prœliantur autem telis &
ingentibus gladiis & brevibus cetris. erant Brittonum gladii, ut ait
Tacitus, sine mucrone.

XVII. Genus hoc erat ex essedis pugnæ, ut Cæsar in IV. narrat. primo
per omnes partes perequitant. & tela conjiciunt, ac ipso terrore
equorum, & strepitu rotarum, ordines plerumque perturbant: & quum
se inter equitum turmas insinuavere, ex essedis desiliunt & pedibus
dispari prœlio contendunt. Aurigæ interim paululum è prœlio excedunt,
atque ita se collocant, ut, si illi à multitudine hostium premantur,
expeditum ad suos receptum habeant. ita mobilitatem equitum,
stabilitatem peditum in prœliis præstant; ac tantum uso quotidiano, &
excercitatione efficiunt, ut in declivi, ac præcipiti loco incitatos
equos sustinere, & brevi moderari, ac flectere, et per temonem
percurrere, & in jugo insistere, & inde se in currus citissimè recipere
consueverint.

XVIII. Equestris autem prœlii ratio, & cedentibus & insequentibus par
atque idem periculum inferebat. accedebat huc, ut nunquam conferti,
sed rari, magnisque intervallis prœliarentur, stationesque dispositas
haberent, atque alios alii deinceps exciperent, integrique & recentes
defatigatis succederent. utebantur & telis.

XIX. Formam regiminis Brittanici, antè advectos in hanc insulam
Romanos, determinare haud facile: hoc certum, quod nullum ibi antè
hæc tempora Monarchici imperii vestigium, sed Democraticum fuisse,
potiùs videtur, nisi fortè Aristocratiam æmulari videtur. Druidem in
rebus maxumi momenti authoritas non exigua. commemorantur quidem in
antiquissimis eorum monumentis Principes nonnulli, hi verò brevioris
plerumque imperii, nec, nisi ingruente eximio quodam periculo, & more
Dictatorum Romanorum ex tempore creati videntur. nec desunt inter
ipsos, apud alias fortes gentes, rarissima exempla, electi ab illis in
futurum antisignanum ipsius hostium Duces, ut pro illis in posterum
militaret, quem nuper hostem habuerant.

XX. Proceritate corporis Gallos æque ac Romanos vincunt Brittones,
ita ut visos sibi Romæ juvenes nondumque adultos Brittones Strabo
Philosophus, orbis terræ descriptor antiquissimus, affirmet, qui
solitam Gallorum Romanorumque staturam non levi momento excedebant.

XXI. Ditiores australis Brittaniæ incolæ aureo digitorum sinistræ
medium annulo ornare in more habuerunt, aurea verò è collo suspensa
torques à vilioris conditionis hominibus discernebat optimatum
eminentiores. Septentrionales verò (hi veteres erant regni indigenæ)
vestium usus sicuti ac à longo inde tempore avi abavique, tantum non
ignari, ventrem & cervicem ferreo cingunt, ut fert Herodianus, nobilis
Græcorum scriptor, annulo. ornamentum id esse ac divitiarum argumentum
existimantes, accedente in usum potiùs quam ornatum scuto angusto,
& lancea, gladioque è nudis & pictis corporibus dependente. loricam
interim galeamque, futura nempe paludes transeuntibus impedimento,
rejiciunt atque contemnunt.

XXII. Inter cætera autem fuit & hoc Brittanicæ consuetudinis, ut
viatores & mercatores etiam invitos consistere cogerent, & quod
quisque eorum de una alterave re apud exteros memorabile audierit, aut
cognoverit, quærerent, & mercatores peregre advenientes in oppidis
vulgus circumsisteret; quibus ex regionibus veniant; quasque ibi res
cognoverint, pronunciare cogentes, his rumoribus atque auditionibus
permoti, de summis sæpe rebus consilia ineunt, quorum eos è vestigio
pœnitere necesse est, quum incertis rumoribus serviant, & plerique ad
voluntatem eorum ficta respondeant.

XXIII. Funera eorum sunt magnifica & sumptuosa, omniaque, quæ vivis
cordi fuisse arbitrantur, in ignem inferunt, etiam arma & animalia.
sepulchrum tumulus ex cespitibus erigit.


                               CAPUT IV.

Natio Brittonum fuit omnis, ut Gallorum, admodum dedita religionibus;
atque ob eam causam qui gravioribus affecti morbis, quique in prœliis
periculisque versabantur, aut pro victimis homines immolabant, aut se
immolaturos vovebant.

II. Ad peragenda crudelia hæc sacra, Druidum utebantur ministerio;
nec credebant placari posse Deos nisi hominis cædes humano sanguine
pensaretur. hinc instituta publicè istiusmodi sacrificia, oblataque, ut
gratissima Diis hostia, qui in furto, latrocinio, aliave graviori culpa
deprehensi, his verò deficientibus, ad innocentium quoque mactationem
descendebant, ut quocunque demum modo Dii placarentur.

III. Nisi adfuerint Druides, res sacra rite celebrari non credebatur.
hinc publica non minus quam privata sacra procurandi negotium illis
unicè incumbebat. erat penes hoc religionis cura, æque ac mysteriorum
interpretatio, corporis quoque & sanitatis sive tuendæ, sive
restituendæ curam habebant, continuò medicinæ peritissimi.

IV. Inter Deos ipsis præcipuè colebatur Mercurius, cujus plurima
prostabant simulachra. post hunc Justitiam, quæ Brittonibus Adraste
dicebatur. hinc Apollinem, Martem, qui etiam Vitucadrus appellabatur.
Jovem, Minervam, Herculem, Victoriam, Andatem vocatam, Dianam, Cybelem
& Plutonem venerabantur, eandem ferè de his Numinibus ac quidem aliæ
gentes opinionem amplexi.

V. A Dite autem, ut & Galli, gentis suæ originem deducere allaborabant
Brittones. antiquissimam hanc venditantes Druidum traditionem, eam
ob causam quælibet temporum spatia, non dierum, sed noctium numero
definiebant, dieique mensis & anni natalis initia ita numerare
consueverunt, ut capto à nocte initio dies subsequeretur, quæ
consuetudo omnino convenit cum antiquissima illa, quæ Gen. I. habetur
noctium ac dierum computatione.

VI. Ad Druides magnus disciplinæ causa confluebat adolescentium
numerus, hi quippe in magno erant apud ipsos honore, nam ferè de
omnibus controversiis, publicis privatisque, constituebant, & si quod
admissum erat facinus, si cædes facta, si de hæreditate, de finibus
controversia erat, iidem decernebant. præmia pœnasque constituerunt, si
quis aut privatus aut publicus eorum decreto non stetit, sacrificiis
interdicebant. hæc exclusionis pœna apud eos erat gravissima. quibus
ita interdictum, ii numero impiorum ac sceleratorum habebantur. iis
omnes decedebant, aditum eorum sermonemque defugientes, ne quid ex
contagione incommodi acciperent: neque iis petentibus jus reddebatur,
neque honos habebatur ullus.

VII. His autem omnibus Druidibus præerat unus, qui summam inter eos
potestatem habebat & authoritatem. hoc mortuo, successor dabatur, qui
inter reliquos excellebat dignitate. at si plures essent dignitate
pares, suffragio Druidum res committebatur; nonnunquam etiam de
Principatu armis contendebant.

VIII. Druides à bello abesse solebant, neque tributa una cum
reliquis pendebant, militiæ vacationem, omniumque rerum habebant
immunitatem. tantis excitati præmiis, & sua sponte multi in disciplinam
conveniebant, & à propinquis parentibusque mittebantur.

IX. Magnum ibi numerum versuum ediscere solebant. quod unicum apud eos
memoriæ & annalium genus: itaque nonnulli annos vicenos in disciplina
permanebant. neque fas esse existimarunt eam litteris mandare, quum
tamen in reliquis ferè rebus, publicis privatisque rationibus, Græcis
litteris uterentur. _Id mihi duabus de causis_, inquit D. Julius,
_instituisse videntur; quod neque in vulgus disciplinam efferri velint;
neque eos, qui discunt, litteris confisos, minus memoriæ studere.
quod ferè plerisque accidit, ut præsidio litterarum, diligentiam in
perdiscendo, ac memoriam remittant._

X. Inprimis hoc persuadere allaborabant, non interire animas, sed ab
aliis post mortem transire ad alios: atque hoc maxumè ad virtutem
excitari putabant, metu mortis neglecto. multa præterea de syderibus
atque eorum motu, de mundi & terrarum magnitudine, de rerum natura, de
Deorum vi ac potestate disputabant, & juventuti tradebant sollicitè.

XI. Non est omittenda de Visco admiratio. nihil habebant Druides visco
& arbore, in qua gignatur (si modo sit robur) sacratiùs. jam per se
roborum eligebant lucos. nec ulla sacra sine ea fronde conficiebant, ut
inde appellati quoque interpretatione Græca possint Δρυιδες (Druides)
videri. enimverò quicquid adnascatur illis, è cœlo missum putabant,
signumque esse electæ ab ipso Deo arboris. est autem id rarum admodum
inventu, & repertum magna religione petitur, & antè omnia sexta luna,
quæ principium mensium annorumque bis facit, et seculi, post tricesimum
annum; quia jam virium abunde habebat. nec tamen sit sui dimidia. Omnia
sanantem appellantes suo vocabulo. sacrificia epulisque rite sub arbore
præparatis duos admovebant candidi coloris tauros, quorum cornua tunc
primùm vinciantur. Sacerdos candida veste cultus arborem scandebat,
falce aurea dimetiens. candido id excipiebatur sago. tunc demum
victimas immolant, præcantes, ut suum donum Deus prosperum faceret,
his, quibus dederant, fœcunditatem eo poto dari cuicunque animali
sterili arbitrabantur, contraque venena omnia, esse remedio. tanta
gentium in rebus frivolis plerumque religio fuerat!

XII. Druidarum disciplina in nostra Brittania reperta, atque inde in
Galliam translata esse existimatur. unde Plinius eleganter declamat
lib. XXX. his verbis: _Sed quid ego hæc commemorem in arte Oceanum
quoque transgressa, & ad naturæ inane pervecta? Brittania hodieque
eam attonitè celebrat tantis ceremoniis, ut dedisse Persis videri
possit._ idem Julius Cæsar affirmat in Ephemeridis. _Et nunc, qui
diligentius eam rem cognoscere volunt, plerumque illo, discendi caussa,
proficiscuntur._

XIII. Druides certo anni tempore in finibus Brittaniæ, in insulæ
Monæ luco consecrato, considebant. huc omnes undique, quos inter
controversia, conveniebant, eorumque judiciis decretisque acquiescebant.

XIV. Præter Druides apud Gallos atque Brittones erant Bardi poetæ, qui
Deûm Heroumque res gestas heroicis expositas versibus, cum dulcibus
lyræ modulis cantitabant.

XV. De his ambobus ita cecinit Lucanus vates his versibus, quibus hoc
caput finiam.

    _Vos quoque, qui fortes animas, bellóque peremptas
    Laudibus in longum, vates! dimittitis ævum,
    Plurima securi studuistis carmina Bardi.
    Et vos barbaricos ritus, moremque sinistrum.
    Sacrorum, Druidæ, positis repetistis ab armis.
    Solis nosse Deos, & cœli Numina vobis,
    Aut solis nescire datum: nemora alta remotis
    Incolitis lucis. vobis authoribus, umbræ
    Non tacitas Erebi sedes, Ditisque profundi
    Pallida regna petunt; regit idem spiritus artus
    Orbe alio: longæ, canitis, si cognita, vitæ
    Mors media est. certe populi, quos despicit Arctos,
    Felices errore suo, quos ille timorum
    Maxumus, haud urget Lethi metus: inde ruendi
    In ferrum mens prona viris, animæque capaces
    Mortis: & ignavum redituræ parcere vitæ._


                               CAPUT V.

Optima frugibus atque arboribus insula, & alendis apta pecoribus ac
jumentis. vincas etiam quibusdam in locis germinans. sed & avium
ferax terra marique generis diversi. fluviis quoque multum piscosis,
ac fontibus præclara copiosis, & quidem præcipuè Isicio abundat &
anguilla.

II. Capiuntur autem sæpissimè & vituli marini, & delphines, nec non &
ballenæ, de quo apud Satyricum mentionem inveniamus:

    _Quanto delphinis ballena Brittanica major?_

III. Exceptis autem variorum generibus conchyliorum, in quibus sunt &
musculi, quibus inclusam sæpè margaritam, omnis quidem coloris optimam
inveniunt, id est, & rubicundi, & purpurei, & hyacinthini, & prasini,
sed maxumè candidi, ut scripsit venerabilis Beda in prima Eccl. hist.
ad Regem Confulfum.

IV. Sunt & cochleæ, satis superque abundantes, quibus tinctura coccinei
coloris conficitur, cujus rubor pulcherrimus, nullo unquam solis
ardore, nulla valet pluviarum injuria pallescere; sed quò vetustior
est, eò solet esse venustior.

V. Habet fontes salinarum & fontes calidos, & ex eis fluvios balnearum
calidarum, omni ætati & sexui per distincta loca, juxta suum cuique
modum accommodatos.

VI. Nascitur ibi plumbum album in mediterraneis regionibus, in
maritimis ferrum; sed ejus exigua est copia. ære utuntur importato.
gignit & aurum, & argentum. fert & lapidem gagatem plurimum optimumque.
est autem nigrogemmeus & ardens igni admotus, incensus serpentes fugat,
adtritu calefactus adplicita detinet æque ut succinum.

VII. Et quia Brittania propè sub septentrionali vertice mundi jacet,
lucidas æstate noctes habet; ita ut medio sæpè tempore noctis in
questionem veniat intuentibus, utrum crepusculum adhuc permaneat
vespertinum, an jam advenerit matutinum? utpote nocturno sole non longè
sub terris ad orientem boreales per plagas redeunte. unde etiam plurimæ
longitudinis habet dies æstate, sicut et noctes contra in bruma, sole
nimirum tunc in Lybicas partes secedente, id est, horarum X & VIII.
ut author est Cleomedes. plurimæ item brevitatis nocte æstate & dies
habet in bruma, hoc est, VI. solummodo æquinoctialium horarum: cum
in Armenia, Macedonia, Italia, cæterisque ejusdem lineæ regionibus
longissima dies sive nox XV. brevissima VIIII. compleat horas.

VIII. Sed de Brittania Brittonibusque in genere satis prolixè
commemoravi. res ipsa requirit ad particularia tandem descendere,
atque, in sequentibus, statum fatumque diversarum, quæ hanc insulam
incoluerunt, nationum, quæ eandem nobilitarunt, civitates, _cet._
quales sub ditione Romana erant, ex ordine depingere mei jam erit
propositi.


                               CAPUT VI.

Brittania, secundum accuratissima veterum, quæ propiùs fidem sunt,
monumenta, erat omnis divisa in partes septem; quarum sex alio atque
alio tempore imperio Romano adjectæ fuerunt, septima verò sub solis
barbaris Caledoniis.

II. Supra dictæ Brittaniæ partes erant Brittania Prima, Secunda,
Flavia, Maxima, Valentia & Vespasiana. quarum ultima non diu stetit in
manibus Romanorum, ex his Brittaniam Primam à Flavia Thamesis flumen, à
Brittania Secunda mare dividit. Flavia initium capit à mari Germanico,
continetur Thamesi fluvio, Sabrina à finibus Silurum Ordovicumque,
vergit ad Septemtriones & Brigantum regionem. Maxima ab extremis
Flaviæ finibus oritur pertinet ad inferiorem partem muri, qui totam
ex transverso percurrit insulam, spectatque in Septemtriones. Spatium
inter ambos, hunc & alium, qui ab Imperatore Antonino Pio inter Bdoram
& Clyddam exstructus est, murum occupat Valentia_na_. Vespasiana autem
à Bdoræ æstuario ad civitatem Alcluith, unde linea ad ostium fluminis
Vararis ducta. terminos ostendit. Secunda ad eam partem Oceani, quæ
ad Hyberniam pertinet, spectat inter occasum & Septemtriones. sed de
provinciis satis.

III. Necessarium verò ducimus, antequam ad accuratiorem nos conferamus
descriptionem, Regiminis in hisce Provinciis constitutionem paucis
attingere, deprehendimus adeoque, totam antiquissimis temporibus,
plurimum Regulorum Statuumque arbitrio divisim paruisse Brittaniam,
quorum nonnulli, etiam post occupatam à Romanis Provinciam, superfuisse
commemorantur, sed vix umbra Regiæ dignitatis istis Principibus
relicta, contrarium nempe dissuadente politicâ illâ, quâ Romani olim,
præ cultissimis etiam quibusque gentibus, inclaruerunt prudentia.
Victricibus Romanorum armis subjugatæ imperitoriâ authoritate
constitutus præerat +LEGATUS+, ipsa Brittania verò Provincia erat
+PROCONSULARIS+. per plures hæc Imperii constitutio duravit ætates,
licet in plures interim ipsa insula divisa fuerit partes. primùm
nempe in _superiorem_ & _inferiorem_, deinceps verò, uti antea
demonstravimus, in _septem_ dispertita _Provincias_, mutatâ regiminis
formâ. deinde diu paruit, ut imperitoria sedes, hæc insula Carausio,
eisque, quos in societatem adsciverat, Tyrannis. gloria & præsidium
Christianismi Constantinus Magnus creditur Maximam & Valentiam
+CONSULARES+, Primam, Secundam & Flaviam +PRÆSIDIALES+ fecisse,
toti verò insulæ præpositus est +VICARIUS+ vir perspicabilis sub
dispositione viri illustris Domini Præfecti Prætorii Galliæ. præter
quem in vetusto quodam volumine circa eadem tempora commemoratur
aliquis eximiæ dignitatis vir, titulô +COMITIS BRITTANIARUM+ insignis,
alius itidem, +COMES LITTORIS SAXONICI+, tertius præterea +DUX
BRITTANIÆ+ dictus, aliique plures, magnis præfecti muneribus, quæ, cum
distincta eorum notitia, injuria temporis, impetrari non potuerit,
cogimur taciti præterire.

IV. Prolixum nunc tandem iter ingredior, totam non minus insulam, quam
singulasque ejus partes curiosa lustraturus indagine, pressurusque
optimorum in hoc negotiô authorum vestigia. fiat verò ab extremâ Primæ
provinciæ orâ initium, cujus littora Galliæ objiciuntur. tres verò
laudatissimos validissimosque Status, Cantianum nempe, Belgicum &
Damnonicum complectitur hæc provincia, de quibus eâ, quâ fieri poterit,
curâ nobis sigillatim agendum. Cantium primò lustremus.

¶ V. Ad extremam Brittaniæ Primæ orientalem oram remotam CANTIUM,
Cantiis quondam habitatum, civitatibus Durobrobi & Cantiopoli, quæ
eorum metropolis. hic sepultus est D. Augustinus Anglorum Apostolus.
Dubræ, Lemanus & Regulbium, præsidiô à Romanis munita, eorumque
Primarium Rhutupi, deducta eô Coloniâ, Metropolis factam, portusque
classi Romanorum, quæ Oceano Septentrionali dominabatur, recipiendæ
factus idoneus. tanti nominis fuit hæc civitas, ut littora vicina ex ea
dicta sint Rhutupina, de quibus Lucanus poeta:

    _Aut vaga cum Thetis Rhutupinaque littora fervent._

inde quoque ingentia & grati saporis ostrea Romam translata, ut author
est Juvenalis Satyricus his verbis:

    ————————_Circeis nata forent, an
    Lucrinum ad saxum, Rhutupinóve edita fundo
    Ostrea, callebat primo deprendere morsu._

Statio etiam fuit sub dispositione viri spectabilis Comitis littoris
Saxonici legionis secundæ Augustæ.

VI. Quam plurimis hoc Cantiorum regnum fluminibus rigatur, quorum
celebriora: Madus, Sturius, Dubris & Lemanus, qui Cantios à Bibrocis
discernebat.

VII. Inter tria ista præcipua Brittaniæ promuntoria, eminet illud, quod
à Cantio nomen habet, ibi Oceanus in angulum quasi redactus cursum ita
promovet, fluxionemque suam donec, ut Veteres tradunt, fretum istud
Oceani, quod jam Brittaniæ format insulam, effecerit.

VIII. A Cantio vasta illa, quæ Anterida nonnullis, aliis Caledonia
dicta sylva latè extenditur ad CL. milliaria per Bibrocorum ac
Segontiacorum terras ad Heduorum usque fines excurrens, de hac sylva
ita cecinit Lucanus:

    _Unde Caledoniis fallit turbata Brittanos._

IX. Cantiis proximi, et ut putant nonnulli, subjecti Bibroci, qui &
aliis Rhemi dicuntur: natio in monumentis non penitus ignota, quibus
habitatum Bibroicum, Regentium, Noviomagumque metropolis. Anderidam
verò occupatam tenuerunt Romani.

X. Confines illis apud ripam Thamesis habitabant Attrebates, quorum
urbs primaria Caleba.

XI. Infra hos, proprius flumen Cunetium, habitabant Segontiaci, quorum
caput fuit Vindonum.

XII. Ad Oceanum, Bibrocis affines, inferius habitabant, sic dicti,
Belgæ, quorum urbes primariæ Clausentum, quod nunc _Sotheamptona_
dicitur, Portus Magnus, omniumque præcipua Venta, nobilissima civitas
ad flumen Antonam sita. Sorbiodunum verò tenebat præsidium Romanorum.
Omnes enim Belgæ Allobroges sunt, & suam à Celtis Belgisque originem
traxere, hi, non multis ante Cæsaris adventum in hanc insulam seculis,
relictâ patriâ Galliâ, à Germanorum Romanorumque populis infestatâ,
atque devictâ, illi, qui, trajecto flumine Rheni, eorum expugnatas
occupavere regiones, de quo autem prolixius M. Dictator Cæsar, sedem
heic sibi elegerunt.

XIII. Omnes regiones, quæ Thamesi, versus meridiem, adjacent, olim, uti
vetera monumenta declarant, à bellicosa Senonum gente fuerunt occupatæ;
qui, sub ductu & auspicio decantatissimi Regis Brenni, peragratâ
Galliâ, Alpibusque, adhuc inviis, sibi patefactis, Romam fastu elatam
ista incursione vastam solo facile æquassent, nisi Rempublicam Romanam,
quam more nutricis in sinu quasi gestare (dum infra destinatum ab
illis fastigium agebat) videbantur Fata, cladem aversura Manlium
clangore anseris excitassent, qui, circa montem unum pendentes, & nocte
subeuntes, Barbaros à summo Capitolio dejecit. huic eadem Numinum cura
Camillum postea auxilio misit, qui abeuntes à tergo aggressus ita
cecidit, ut Senonici sanguinis inundatione omnia incendiorum vestigia
deleret, urbemque ita ruinæ proximam ab interitu vindicaret. Senones
autem ob valentissimam hanc expeditionem natale solum, ut cultoribus
vacuum, ita prædâ refertissimum alienæ genti, quam Belgas supra
nominatos, fuisse, satis liquet, concesserunt.

XIV. Ad Sabrinam, Thamesi inferius, habitabant Hedui, urbes eorum
Ischalis & Avalonia. Thermæ, quæ & Aquæ Solis nuncupabantur, Romanorum,
qui hanc Brittaniæ oram tenebant, factæ colonia & perpetua sedes. urbs
nominatissima hæc erat, ad flumen Abonam sita, ibique fontes callidi,
opiparo exsculpti apparatu, ad usus mortalium; quibus fontibus præsules
erant Apollinis & Minervæ Numina, in quorum ædibus perpetui ignes
nunquam labascunt in favillas, sed ubi ignis tabuit vertitur in globos
saxeos.

XV. Infra Heduorum terras siti erant Durotriges, qui & Morini aliàs
vocantur. Metropolin habebant Durinum & promuntorium Vindeliam. in
horum finibus sensim coarctatur Brittania, & immensum efformare videtur
brachium, quod irruptionem minitantem commodè repellit Oceanum.

XVI. In hoc brachio, quæ intermissione Uxellæ amnis, Heduorum regioni
protenditur, sita erat regio Cimbrorum, utrúmne verò modernum
Walliæ nomen dederint, an verò antiquior sit Cimbrorum origo? non
æque constat. urbes illis præcipuæ Termolus & Artavia. visuntur
hic, antiquis sic dictæ, Herculis columnæ, & non procul hinc insula
Herculea. sed à fluminis Uxellæ finibus continuum procurrit montium
jugum, cui nomen Ocrinum, extremumque ejus ad promuntorium ejusdem
nominis extenditur.

XVII. Ultra Cimbros extremum insulæ angulum incolebant Carnabii,
unde forsitan, quod hodieque retinet nomen, obtinuit Carnubia. urbes
habebant Musidum & Halangium. cum verò has olim desertas propemodum &
incultas Brittaniæ partes Romani nunquam salutaverint, minoris omnino
momenti urbes eorum fuisse videntur, & Historicis propterea neglectæ,
Geographis tamen memorantur promuntoria Bolerium & Antivestæum.

XVIII. Memoratis modo populis in littore Oceani austrum versus affines
ad Belgas-Allobroges sedem habebant Damnonii, gens omnium validissima,
quæ ratio movisse videtur Ptolemæum, ut totum hunc terræ tractum, qui
in mare brachii instar prætenditur, illis adscripserit. urbes habebant
Uxellam, Tamaram, Volubam, Ceniam omniumque matrem Iscam, fluvio
cognomini imminentem. fluvii apud ipsos præcipui memorati modo Isca,
Durius, Tamarus atque Cenius. ora eorum maritima promuntoria exhibet
tria, de quibus mox paulò dicemus. hanc regionem, utpote metallis
abundantem, Phænicibus, Græcis & Gallis mercatoribus probe notam fuisse
constat. hi enim ob magnam, quam terra ferebat, stanni copiam eò sua
frequenter extendebant negotia; cujus rei præcipua sunt documenta supra
nominata tria promuntoria Helenis scilicet, Ocrinum & Κριοῦ μέτωπον ut
& nomina civitatum, Græcam Phœniciamque originem redolentia.

XIX. Ultra brachium in Oceano sitæ sunt insulæ Sygdiles, quæ etiam
Oestrominides & Cassiterrides vocabantur, dictæ.

XX. Cum prænominatis Damnoniis Belgisque conjunctis XXX. prœlia
commisisse narratur valentissimus ille Imperator Vespasianus. decem
hi ad australes Thamesis & Sabrinæ ripas habitantes populi, à Romanis
sensim subacti, eorumque regiones in provinciæ formam redactæ, quæ
BRITTANIA PRIMA fuit appellata, cum hic fuerit in istis terris primus
Romanorum victoriæ fructus.

¶ XXI. Succedit ordine BRITTANIA SECUNDA quæ à prioribus, interfluente
Sabrina amne, discernitur. à provincia autem Flavia, tum memoratus
amnis, tum Deva fluvius eandem sejungit, reliquum cingitur à mari
Interno. Hæc erat celebrata illa regio Silurum, tribus validissimis
habitata populis, quos inter præ reliquis celebres Silures propriè sic
dicti, quam ab ora relicta turbidum Sabrinæ fretum distinguit. cujus
homines, ut eruditissimus Solinus est author, etiam nunc custodiunt
morem vetustum, nundinas ac nummum refutant, dant res & accipiunt;
mutationibus necessaria potiùs, quam pretiis parant. Deos percolunt,
scientiam futurorum pariter viri ac fœminæ ostendunt.

XXII. Civitates Silurum, Sariconium, Magna, Gobaneum & Venta, eorum
caput, fuerunt. Iscæ verò, flumini imminentem urbem cognominem,
tenebat Romanorum Colonia, ibique per annos plures secunda legio, quæ
Augusta aliàs vocabatur, stationem habebat, donec Valentiam & Rhutupin
transferebatur. hæc erat provinciæ Secundæ primaria Romana.

XXIII. Olim ac diu potens erat hæc Silurum regio, sed, cum eam regno
Charaticus tenuit, longe potentissima. hic continuis novem annis,
omnia Romanorum arma pro ludibrio habita, sæpe evertit, donec de illo,
conjunctis viribus Romanos aggressuro, triumphavit Legatus Ostorius.
Charaticus enim, prœlio evadens, auxiliumque à vicinis Regibus petens,
per astutiam matronæ Romanæ Carthismandvæ cum Rege Brigantiæ Venutio
nuptæ, Romanis deditus est. post id temporis masculè tantum suam ipsius
ditionem idem ille populus defendit usque dum à Varionio spoliatus, ac
tandem à Frontino devictus in formam Romanæ, cui BRITTANIA SECUNDA, ut
supra meminimus nomen erat, provinciæ suum redigi pateretur imperium.

XXIV. Duæ aliæ sub Siluribus gentes fuere, primum Ordovices, qui in
septentrionali versus insulam Monam: & deinde Dimeciæ, qui in extrema
versus occidentem partem degebant, ubi promuntorium quod Octorupium
nuncupatur, unde in Hyberniam transitus XXX. milliarium. Dimeciarum
urbes Menapia, & primaria Muridunum. Lovantium verò sibi habitandum
vendicaverant Romani. ultra hos & Silurum terminos siti Ordovices,
quorum urbes Mediolanum & Brannogenium. Sabrina in montibus illorum
oriunda majoribus tribus Brittaniæ fluviis meritò accensetur, addito
nempe Thamesi & Tavo. elucet imprimis in historia nomen Ordovicum ob
sumtam de inclutissimi ipsorum Regis captivitate vindictam. hinc enim
toties redactum in angustias exercitum Romanorum tam misere vexarunt,
ut de illorum ferè imperio in hac regione actum fuisset, ni in tantæ
cladis vindictam postea surrexisset Dux Agricola, qui, victricia
circumferens arma, totam quoque hanc gentem subjugavit, maximamque
partem ferro delevit.

XXV. Huc quoque referendum illud, quod à septentrione Ordovicum situm,
ab Oceano alluitur, territorium, cum illorum regimini aliquandiu
fuerit subjectum, hoc certo constat, quod illum Cangiani quondam
inhabitaverint tractum, quorum urbs unica Segontium, promuntorio
Cangano vicina. incluta hæc erat civitas, freto Meneviaco, contra
Monam, religiosissimam insulam, ubi olim Druides habitâre, adjacet. in
hac insula plurima sita erant oppida, tota autem insula in circuitu
LX. m. p. ferè complectitur, atque, ut refert Plinius, à Camaloduno
colonia CC. m. p. abest. fluvii apud ipsos Tosibus, qui & Canovius;
pro terminis verò erat utraque Deva. in hac vero regione mons Eriri
celsissimus maxumusque invenitur. Ordovicia una cum Cangiorum
Carnabiorumque regionibus, ni fama me fallit, nomine Genaniæ sub
Imperatoribus post Trajani principatum inclarescebat.

¶ XXVI. Ordo jam ad illam nos deducit provinciam, quæ FLAVIA Romanis
vocata, unde verò hoc nomen acceperit, utrum à matre Constantini Magni
Flavia Julia Helena, ex his terris oriunda? an verò à Romanorum familia
Flavia? quominus determinari possit, obstat injuria temporum, quæ nobis
invidet genuina quæ huc facerent antiquitatis monumenta.

XXVII. Ad fluvium Devam primò siti erant Carnabii, quibus habitatæ
fuerunt Benonæ, Etocetum, Banchorium, monasterium totius insulæ
celeberrimum, quod in contentione Augustini eversum, non postea
resurrexit, & reliquarum mater Uriconium, quæ, inter Brittaniæ
civitates maxumas, nomen possidebat. in extremo hujus terræ angulo
flumini Devæ imminebat cognominis Romanorum colonia Deva, opus
vicesimæ legionis, quæ Victrix dicebatur, & olim illius erat regionis
tutela. hæc eadem esse existimatur quæ jam _West-Chester_ vocatur.

XXVIII. Infra nominatos regnum Cassium à Rege Ptolemæo Catieuchlani
appellatum extendebatur, aut Respublica potius, quæ ex binis gentibus
coaluerat. harum, quæ Sabrinæ proxima, vocabatur Dobuni, vel, ut Dio
celeberrimus scriptor annalibus inseruit, Boduni. apud hos oritur
flumen Thamesis & deinde longo spatio per fines Heduorum, Attrebatum,
Cassiorum, Bibrocorum, Trinobantum, & Cantiorum citatus fertur, &
Oceanum Germanicum influit, urbes Dobunorum erant Salinæ, Branogena, ad
sinistram Sabrinæ ripam, Alauna, & cui reliquiæ nomen laudemque debent,
Corinum, urbs perspicabilis, opus, ut tradunt, Vespasiani Ducis.
Glevum verò, in extremo regni contra regionem Silurum situm, Romana
tenebat colonia, quam deduxit Claudius Cæsar, ut scriptores de istis
temporibus affirmant. finitimi illis Cassii, quorum urbes Forum Dianæ
& Verulamium. cum verò hæc ad municipiam dignitatem à Romanis evecta,
ejus præ aliis urbibus eminentia illis omnino adscribenda. his natus
erat D. Albanus Martyr. hæc civitas ruina Camaloduni, Londiniique,
in seditione à Bondvica excitata, cujus in annalibus mentionem facit
eruditissimus Tacitus, involuta erat. hi Cassii olim, præ cæteris
insulæ gentibus, caput extulere, atque cum inclutissimo eorum Rege
Cassibellino (cui non paucæ nationes fuere tributariæ) Dictator Cæsar
multos eosdemque gravissimos, sub readventum ipsius in hanc insulam,
habuit conflictus, sed ab eadem ille gente cum Siluribus conjuncta
fugatus, unde & emendatissimus Lucanus:

    _Territa quæsitis ostendit terga Britannis._

adventante autem ipso Imperatore Claudio, omnes cum vicinis fracti
sunt, eorumque regio in formam Romanæ provinciæ redacta, nomineque,
+CÆSARIENSIS+, & postea FLAVIA, nuncupata.

XXIX. Juxta Cassios, ubi se Oceano Thamesis propinquavit, regio
Trinobantum sita erat. natio quæ non modo sponte in Romanorum concessit
amicitiam, sed illis quoque ut colonias ibi ponerent metropolim
suam Lundinum & Camalodunum ad mare sita obtulerunt. in hac urbe
F_lavia_ J_ulia_ Helena, piissima conjux Constantini Chlori, materque
Constantini Magni, è sanguine Regum Brittanicorum nasci memoriæ
proditum dicunt. prima autem hæc Romanorum in Brittania coloniarum
erat, templo Claudii, imagine Victoriæ, cum aliis diversis ornamentis
insignis. Lundinum enim mundo cognita civitas erat & erit. primùm
Trinovantum, postea Londinium, dein Augusta, & nunc Londona rursum.
urbe Roma secundum chronicorum fidem, sanè antiquior est, super
ripam Thamesis fluminis posita, & ipsa multorum emporium populorum,
terra marique venientium, hæc à piissima illa Imperatrice Helena.
S. S. Crucis inventrice, circumvallata, atque, si fides sit penes
traditiones, quæ non semper erroneæ sunt, nominata est Augusta, tota
autem Brittania +Romana insula+.

XXX. Limes huic populo ad septentrionem flumen Surius, ultra quem
habitabant Iceni, celeberrima natio, in duas gentes divisa, quarum
prior, Cenomanni habitans ad septentrionem Trinobantes & Cassios, ad
orientem Oceanum spectabat. horum urbes Durnomagus & caput regionis
Venta. Romanorum colonia erat Camboricum. in mare orientem versus
procurens lingula dicitur Flavia extrema. fluminum notissima sunt
Garion, Surius & Aufona in sinum Metorin sese exonerans, ex altera
parte ad Aufonam incolebant, Carnabiis Brigantibus & Oceano vicini,
Coitanni, in tractu sylvis obsito, qui, ut aliæ Brittonum sylvæ,
Caledonia fuit appellata. de hac autem III. mentionem facit historicus
ille Florus. civitas primaria Coitannorum erat Ragæ, & præter hanc
Romanorum colonia Lindum, in extrema ad orientem provinciæ ora. totam
verò regionem bifariam secat fluvius Trivona. Hæc Icenorum gens, quæ,
utpote ferocissima bellique post hominum memoriam studiosissima,
omissis tam rusticis quam civilibus artibus, sua sponte in Romanorum
societatem accesserat, non tantum mox defecerat, sed ad sui quoque
imitationem alios quam plurimos excitaverat, ab Ostorio Duce primùm sub
jugum missa est, aliquot post annos, quum Rex ipsorum, & animo & opibus
valentissimus, Prasutagus moriens Cæsarem ejusdemque posteros heredes
fecerat. Romani autem Icenorum sic abutentes amicitia, ut nulli non se
luxuriæ dederint, ab iisdem postea sociisque, sub ductu bellicosissimæ
Bonduicæ, vidua Regis supra nominati, ita infesti ipsis sunt redditi,
ut combustis deletisque ipsorum coloniis ac municipio, civium denique
Romanorum LXXX. M. ferro miserè sint trucidati; sed postea ad officium
redegit Suetonius Legatus, multis prudentiæ nominibus suspiciendus.

¶ XXXI. Ad septentrionalem hujus regionis plagam Oceano occurrit
fluvius Abus, quondam terminorum provinciæ MAXIMÆ unus, uti alter
Seteja. dicta quoque hæc provincia fuit Brigantiæ Regnum scilicet
ejusdem nominis regionem complexa, tribusque habitata nationibus, in
extrema orientali plaga, ubi promuntoria Oxellum & Brigantum extrema
in mare procurrunt, habitabant Parisii, quorum urbes Petuaria & Portus
Felix.

XXXII. Supra hos, uti & ad latus, siti erant propriè sic dicti
Brigantes, gens numerosissima, toti olim provinciæ leges præscribens.
his cultæ civitates, Epiacum, Vinovium, Cambodunum, Cataracton,
Galacum, Olicana, & primaria Isurium. Eboracum verò, ad Urum fluvium,
caput provinciæ. primùm colonia nomine Sextæ à Romanis factum, sextæque
deinde legionis, quæ Victrix dicebatur, sedes. deinceps verò plurium
Imperatorum præsentia illustrior factum, municipii quoque auctum
prærogativis.

XXXIII. Totam in æquales ferè partes provinciam dividunt montes Alpes
Penini dicti. hi, ad Icenorum Carnabiorumque fines ad fluvium Trivonam
surgentes, continua serie per CL. milliaria septentrionem versus
decurrunt.

XXXIV. Populi, ad occidentalem hujus jugi partem habitantes, sunt
Volantii Sistuntiique arctiori, ut videtur, fœdere conjuncti. urbes
habebant Rerigonum, Coccium & Lugubalium, quarum tamen posteriores
binas Romanorum tenebant præsidia.

XXXV. Septentrionales hujus terræ limites tegebat murus iste stupendæ
molis, à Romanis per Isthmum ad longitudinem LXXX. milliarium extensus,
cujus altitudo XII. crassities verò IIX. pedes æquabat, turribusque
ornatus, murus erat.

XXXVI. Gentem hanc, ab Imperatore Claudio primùm infestatam, deinde
ab Ostorio Legato devictam, postea à Cereali fractam & magnam partem
debellatam, ex historia colligitur. cum verò sponte se Agricolæ
dedisset, pacem illi datam esse percepimus. Famam hujus gentis in
historiis precipue delêrunt turpia Reginæ ipsorum gesta inauditaque
perfidia. ipsa harum potentium nationum progenies erat, quæ novas
electura sedes, ultimùm ultrò, patriæ, inter Alpes, Danubium & Rhodanum
jacenti, valedicebat. ex his in Hyberniam postea nonnulli, sedem ibi
fixuri, transierunt, ut ex documentis constat.

¶ XXXVII. His borealiores erant nationes istæ validissimæ olim sub
nomine Maætarum venientes, à quibus, mortuo patre, fratricida iste
Bassianus suam turpiter pacem emit. regiones, quas tenuêre, sequentes
erant, in orientem Ottadinia, inde Gadenia, post hanc Selgovia, deinde
Novantia, supra hos etiam Damnia.

XXXVIII. Muro proximi habitabant Gadeni, quorum metropolis Curia. ad
Oceanum verò proprius siti Ottadini, eorumque caput Bremenium, ac apud
hos fluvii Tueda, Alauna, & utraque Tina, infra murum decurrentes.

XXXIX. His occidentaliores ad Oceanum siti erant Selgovæ, eorumque
urbes Corbantorigum, Uxellum & Trimontium, quam tamen sat diu tenuit
præsidium Romanorum, quod antiqua memorant monumenta. hujus regionis
fluvii præcipui fuerunt Novius, Deva &, ex parte, Ituna.

XL. Ultra Devam, nuper dictam, ad Oceani quoque oram in extrema insulæ
parte, Hyberniam versus, Novantes siti erant. apud quos celebris illa
Novantum chersonesus, Hybernia distans milliaria XXVIII. hæc inter
cuncta Brittaniæ promuntoria maxumè borea antiquis credebantur, juxta
verò, æque ac illi, causam non video. metropolis horum Lucophibia,
aliàs Casæ candidæ. fluvii verò Abrasuanus, Jena &, ad orientem
regionis terminus, Deva.

XLI. Supra Novantes, Selgovas & Gadenos, interveniente montium
Uxellorum serie, habitabant Damnii, prævalens quidem natio, sed quæ
condito muro non parvum regionis suæ tractum amisit, à Caledoniis
subjugatum & spoliatum. præter illud quod murum tuebatur præsidium
Vanduarium tenebat Romanus miles.

XLII. Hic Brittania, rursus quasi amplexu Oceani delectata, angustior
evadit, quam alibi, idque ob duo ista rapidissima, quæ infunduntur,
æstuaria Bodotriam scilicet & Clottam. contractus hic Isthmus ab
Agricola Legato primùm præsidio munitus erat. alium murum, in historiis
nobilissimum, erexit imperator Antoninus, ad XXXV. circiter milliaria
protensum; ut hoc medio barbarorum sisteret incursiones, qui & ab
Ætio Duce demum reparatus est, undecimque firmatus turribus. has verò
regiones pro illa habeo provincia, quæ per victoriosam Romanorum aciem
sub Imperatore Theodosio revocata, atque in honorem Imperatoris, tunc
ad clavum imperii sedentis, VALENTIANA dicta putatur.

¶ XLIII. Extra murum sita provincia VESPASIANA. hæc est Caledonia
regio, à Romanis nimiùm quantum & desiderata militibus, & incolis
valde defensa. negotium, cujus amplam historiæ Romanæ, aliàs nimis
de istiusmodi rebus silentes, mentionem faciunt. hic fluvium Tavum
conspicere licet, qui longo cursu regionem in duas quasi partes
dissecare videtur. hic quoque arduum atque horrendum jugum Grampium
offendimus, quod provinciam istam bifariam secabat. atque hæc eadem
erat regio, quæ, à commisso inter Agricolam & Galgacum prœlio,
Romanis utilissimo, famam in annalibus habet insignem. hi vires eorum
veteresque castramentationes hodieque magnitudo ostendit mœnium, nam
in loco ubi ingens supradictum prœlium habitum erat, quidam ordinis
nostri, hanc viam emensi, affirmant, se immania vidisse castra, aliaque
argumenta Taciti relationem confirmantia.

XLIV. Nationes verò, Romanis hic subjectæ, ordine jam sequentur.
ultra Isthmum, atque ad Tavum, gens erant Horrestii, quorum urbes,
post prætenturam quidem exstructam, prius enim Damniis accensebantur,
fuerunt Alauna, Lindum, &, re non minus quam nomine reliquis
gloriosior, Victoria, ab Agricola ad flumen Tavum XX. milliaria ab
ejusdem in mare exitu ædificata, memoriæ proditum dicunt.

XLV. Supra hos ultra Tavum, qui limites constituit, erant Vecturones,
sive Venricones, quorum urbs primaria Orrea, fluvii verò Æsica & Tina.

XLVI. Oceani littus, ultra horum fines, accolebant Taixali, his urbium
princeps Divana, fluvii autem Deva & Ituna. pars Grampii montis, quæ,
ut promuntorium, late se in Oceanum, quasi in Germaniæ occursum,
extendit, ab illis nomen mutuatur.

XLVII. His contermini ad occidentem, interveniente montium Grampiorum
serie, exstitêre Vacomagi, qui amplissimam regionem tenebant, quorum
urbes Tuessis, Tamea & Banatia. Romanorum autem statio, simulque
provinciæ urbs primaria, erat, ad ostium fluvii Varar in littore situm,
Ptoroton. notiores hujus regionis fluvii præter Vararem, qui provinciam
terminabat, fuerunt Tuesis & Celnius.

XLVIII. Infra Vacomagos Tavumque habitabant Damnii-Albani. gentes parum
notæ, & intra lacuum montiumque claustra plane reconditæ.

XLIX. Inferius adhuc Clottæ ripas accolebant Attacoti, gens toti
aliquando olim Brittaniæ formidanda, maxumus hic visitur lacus, cui
nomen olim Lyncalidor, ad cujus ostium condita à Romanis urbs Alcluith,
brevi tempore à Duce Theodosio nomen sortita, qui accupatam à barbaris
provinciam recuperaverat; cum hac comparari potuit nulla, utpote quæ,
post fractas cæteras circumjacentes provincias, impetum hostium ultimo
sustinuit.

L. Hæc provincia dicta est, in honorem familiæ Flaviæ, cui suam
Domitianus Imperator originem debuit, & sub quo expugnata, VESPASIANA.
&, ni fallor, sub ultimis Imperatoribus nominata erat THULE, de qua
Claudianus vates his versibus facit mentionem;

    ————_incaluit Pictorum sanguine Thule
    Scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis Hierne._

sed non tam diu sub aquila suopte tenuerent Romani, ut posteritati
innotescerent ejusdem & nomina & subjectio. cursorio hucusque oculo,
qualis sub Romanorum Imperio erat, Brittaniam lustravimus. restat ut
parili compendio Caledoniorum terras lustremus.


                             De CALEDONIA.

LI. Licet tota ultra Isthmum prædictum Brittania non improprie dici
posset Caledonia, ipsi tamen Caledonii ultra Vararem sedem habuêre,
unde ducta linea terminum Romani in Brittaniam imperii accuratè satis
ostendit. citerior verò insulæ pars alio atque alio tempore ab illis
possessa fuit, reliqua, ut supra meminimus, à Brittonibus barbaris
occupata. hucusque & proficiscentibus lumen aliquod fœnerant antiqua
historiarum monumenta. trajicientes autem Varar flumen, extincto
lumine, in obscuro quasi versamur, & quamvis non nobis ignotum sit,
exstructas ibi pro limitibus Imperii Romani fuisse aras, Ulyssemque,
tempestate fluctibusque jactatum heic vota persolvisse, siquidem
condensæ arboribus sylvæ cum perpetuis montium saxetis ab ulteriori nos
scrutatione prohibent. relationem sequentem à mercatoribus Brittonibus
fugitivis acceptam posterisque relictam, ut sufficientem æstimemus,
necesse est.

LII. Ad occidentem igitur Vararis habitabant Caledonii proprie sic
dicti, quorum regionis partem tegebat immensa illa Caledonia sylva.

LIII. Littus incolebant minores quidam populi, ex quorum numero ultra
Vararem & erectas supradictas aras ad Loxam fluvium habitabant Cantæ,
in quorum finibus promuntorium Penoxullum.

LIV. Huic ordine proximus est fluvius Abona ejusdemque accolæ Logi.
hinc Ila fluvius & ad illum siti Carnabii Brittonum extremi, qui ab
Ostorio Proprætore subjugati jugum Romanum indigne ferentes, adscitis
in societatem Cantiis, ut referunt traditiones, trajectoque mari ibi
sedem eligunt. in varia heic promuntoria sese extendit Brittania,
quorum primum antiquis dictum Vinvedrum, tum Verubrium, aut extremitas
Caledoniæ.

LV. Post illos Cantini. deinde, interiores Logisque proximi, Mertæ siti
sunt. in his oris promuntorium Orcadum positum. cui adjacebant Orcades
insulæ. ulterius manabat Nabæus fluvius, qui terminus erat Carnabicæ
jurisdictionis.

LVI. Ad inferiorem hujus regionis partam habitabant Carnonacæ, in
quorum finibus promuntorium Ebudum, ad cujus extrema eximium Oceanus
sinum efformat, qui olim Volsas appellatus. ad inferiorem istius
sinus ripam tendebant Cerones, & infra Ityn Creones ad Longum usque
procurrit. inde Oceanum inter & sinum Lelanum dictum ab incolis Epidiis
promuntorium.

LVII. Provectus jam ultra flumen Vararis, idem illud remetiri non
possum, quin in transgressu admirer Romanos, aliàs satis expertos
judicio atque experientia, heic quasi destitutos tam perabsurda
opinione laborasse, ut istam Brittaniæ partem, quæ jam armis ipsorum
intacta quiescebat, reliquam jam subactum atque possessam longe
majori & longitudine & latitudine metirentur. (quam tamen eos fovisse
opinionem satis superque constat.) qui enim ea, qua par est, mente
insignem Romanorum ambitionem atque insatiabilem regnandi cupidinem
consideraverit, & quo hostem vix ira ipsorum & notitia, nedum timore
dignum excluderent stupenda ista, quæ totum orbem in admirationem sui
facile trahunt, opera erexisse. in hoc ut in cæteris quam plurimis
magnam summi Numinis merito providentiam veneremur, cui ut omnia
subjecta sunt regna, ita & sempiterna ab incolis gloria debetur & erit,
Amen.

Lustratis ita pro instituti ratione cursim terris Brittanicis,
necessarium videtur, antequam ad insularum descriptionem aggrediar,
dubio à non nemine moto occurrere; ubinam, inquit ille, earum quas
tu nobis commemoras urbium nominumque vestigia? habentur nulla!
Licet vicissim quærere, ubinam hodie sint Assyrii, Parthi, Sarmatæ,
Celtiberi? at qui has celeberrimas gentes exstitisse neget, impudentem
satis spero futurum neminem, nonne inveniuntur hodienum regiones
urbesque permultæ eisdem, quæ ante duo vel plura annorum millia
habuerunt, quæ compellantur, nominibus? Judæa, Italia, Gallia,
Brittania, non hodie minus, quam priscis illis temporibus nota.
Londinum hodieque lingua vernacula sono non adeo discrepante _London_
appellatur. Incuria majorum & in colligendis ac conservandis illis, quæ
huc facere & tunc temporis non difficulter haberi poterant monumentis
negligentia si attendatur, non adeo quidem graviter illa videtur
increpanda, vel ut hujus defectus unica & primaria causa censenda,
vix enim præter illos, qui ordini sacrorum se dederant, operam libris
scribendis commodabant. hi verò à sacro alienum censuerunt munere
profanis istiusmodi, ut vocabant, negotiis operam suam impendere.
Crediderim potius nos sine periculo scire, & sine piaculo ad posteros
transmittere posse illa, quæ de prisco regnorum statu sedula veterum
monumentorum perlustratio & accuratius scrutinium poterit investigare.
ad aliud verò sentiendum me ferè compulisset bonus ille Antistes, ita
me compellare visus: tune solus ignoras quam breve, nobis in hoc orbe,
temporis spatium sit exigendum omnesque nostros etiam laboriosissimos
conatus ab inutilium servorum nomine nos non posse reddere immunes?
omniaque nostra studia proximi usum pro scopo debent habere? hæc! cui
unquam sunt usui? bullatis istiusmodi nugis mundum deludi! His merito
reponimus. an ergo prohibita nobis simul omnis honesta delectatio?
nonne eximiæ divina providentiæ documenta produnt istiusmodi
narrationes? indene patet, quomodo Evangelia de morte & merito
Christi concio universum collustraverit & vicerit orbem gentilibus
ante superstitionibus obnoxium? obvertenti porro, non incongrue fortè
Chronologiæ istiusmodi res in compendio tractari. denuo repono. nec
ergo nimium quidquam est novisse, majores nostros non, ut nonnulli
fabulantur, Autochtones fuisse è terra prosilientes. Deum potius naturæ
librum aperuisse, ut ex illo constarer magni opificis omnipotentia,
qualis in Mosis voluminibus eadem descripta proponitur. Denique
forte respondenti, operibus, authori apud posteros nomen laudemque
parituris, exploratorium ignem esse subeundem, hæc inquam dicenti,
& in his subsistendi gratus profiteor tantum his verbis efficaciæ
fuisse, ut etiam suborta michi nonnumquam fuerit cœpti hujus laboris
pœnitentia. Ex altera proinde hujus opusculi parte præter Chronologicam
rerum commemorationem amplius quidquam exspectare nolit Benevolus
Lector, quem adeo benevolentiæ tutelæque Divinæ, paria ab ipso michi
promittens, devotus commendo, sperans, ut me simul cœlesti Patri, qui
misericors & condonationis plenus, commendet.

Quod hactenus auribus, in hoc capite percipitur pene oculis
intuentibus, nam huic adjuncta est mappa Brittaniæ artificialiter
depicta, quæ omnia loca cet. evidenter exprimit, ut ex ea cunctarum
regionum incolas dignoscere detur.

                              CAPUT VIII.

Lustravimus jam Albionem, disitæ non procul inde Hyberniæ, eadem, quâ
hactenus usi fuimus brevitate, descriptionem daturi.

II. Hybernia omnium, post Albionem dictam nuper, maxumè est ad
occidentem quidem sita, sed, sicut contra Septemtriones ea brevior,
ita in meridiem sese trans illius fines plurimum protendens, usque
contra Hispaniæ Tarraconensis septentrionalia, quamvis magno æquore
interjacente, pervenit.

III. Mare, quod Brittaniam & Hyberniam interfluit, undosum & inquietum
est, toto, ut author est Solinus, anno, non nisi æstivis pauculis
diebus, navigabile. in medio inter ambas insula est, quæ olim
appellabatur Monœda, nunc autem Manavia.

IV. Hybernia autem, & sui status conditione, & salubritate ac
serenitate aëris, multum Brittaniæ præstat, ut opinatur Beda, ita, ut
rarò ibi nix plus quam triduaria remaneat, nemo propter hiemem aut fœna
secet aut stabula fabricet jumentis.

V. Nullum ibi reptile videri solet, nullæ viperæ aut serpentes valent.
nam sæpe illò de Brittania allati serpentes mox, ut proximante terris
navigio odore aëris illius adtacti fuerint, intereunt. quin potiùs
omnia penè, quæ de eadem insula sunt, contra venenum valent. denique
vidimus, quibusdam à serpente percussis rasa folia codicum, qui de
Hybernia fuerunt, & ipsam rasuram aquæ imissam ac potui datam talibus
protinus totam vim veneni grassantis totum inflati corporis absumsisse
ac sedasse tumorem.

VI. Dives lactis & mellis insula, nec vinearum expers, piscium
volucrumque, sed & cervorum caprearumque venatu insignis, ut author est
venerabilis Beda.

VII. Cultores ejus, inquit Mela, inconditi sunt & omnium virtutum
ignari, magis quam aliæ gentes, aliquatenus tamen gnari pietatis
ad modum expertes. gens inhospita & bellicosa à Solino Polyhistore
dicti sunt. sanguine interemptorum hausto prius victores vultus suos
oblinunt. fas ac nefas eodem animo ducunt. puerpera, si quando marem
edidit, primos cibos gladio imponit mariti, inque os parvuli summo
mucrone, auspicium alimentorum leviter insert, & gentilibus votis
optat, non aliter quam in bello & inter arma mortem oppetat. qui
student cultui, dentibus mari nantium belluarum insigniunt ensium
capulos, candicant enim ob heburneam claritatem. nam præcipua viris
gloria est in armorum splendore.

VIII. Agrippa, geographus Romanus, longitudinem Hyberniæ DC. millia
passuum esse, latitudinem verò CCC. statuit XX. olim gentibus habitata,
quarum XIIX. littus tenebant.

IX. Hæc autem propria Scottorum patria erat, ab hac egressi, tertiam
in Albione Brittonibus & Pictis gentem addiderunt. sed non idem cum
magno authore Beda sentio, qui Scottos peregrinos esse affirmat. nam,
ut existimo, suam ex Brittania non procul sita originem duxerunt,
inde trajecisse, atque in hac insula sedes occupasse, fidem faciunt
authores. certissimum verò est Damnios, Voluntios, Brigantes, Cangos
aliàsque nationes origine fuisse Brittanicâ, quæ eò postea trajecerunt,
postquam, vel Divitiacus, vel Claudius, vel Ostorius, vel Duces alii
victores illis domi tumultum fecerant. pro ulteriori argumento inservit
lingua antiqua, quæ cum antiqua illa Brittanica & Gallica non parum
consonat, id quod omnibus, utriusque linguæ gnaris satis planum videtur.

X. Septentrionali Hyberniæ lateri obtenditur Oceanus Deucaledonicus.
orientale tegunt Vergivus & Internus. Cantabricus verò australe, uti
occidentale magnus ille Brittanicus, qui & Athlanticus Oceanus, quem
nos quoque ordinem secuti dabimus insulæ & præcipuorum in illa locorum
descriptionem.

XI. Illud, quod ab Oceano Deucaledonico alluitur, hujus insulæ
latus habitabant Rhodogdii, cujus metropolis Rhobogdium erat, in
quorum orientali regione situm erat ejusdem nominis promuntorium, in
occidentali, Boreum promuntorium. fluvii verò Banna, Darabouna, Argitta
& Vidua, austrum versus à Scottis ipsos separabant montes.

XII. Infra promuntorium Boreum littus Brittanici maris ad Venicnium
usque caput incolebant gentes Venicniæ, quibus nomen debent ab illis
dictæ vicinæ insulæ Venicniæ, inferius ad ostium usque Rhebii fluminis,
quarum metropolis Rheba. infra Rhebeum Nagnatæ habitabant ad Libnium
usque, quorum celebris erat ejusdem nominis metropolis. Austrum
versus in recessu sinus Ausobæ siti erant Auterii quibus urbium caput
erat ejusdem nominis. Inferiorem ejusdem regionis partem occupabant
Concangii, ad quorum fines austrum versus manabat Senus, amplus omnino
fluvius, cui adjacebat urbium primaria Macobicum. in angustum heic
apicem coarctata desinit Hybernia. prope Austrinum promuntorium,
ad flumen Senum, sedes habebant Velatorii quorum metropolis Regia,
fluviusque Durius. Lucani verò habitabant, ubi Oceano miscetur fluvius
Ibernus.

XIII. Ultra Austrinum meridionale insulæ latus ab eodem promuntorio
ad Sacrum usque extremum tendebat. Ibernii ad illud habitabant,
quibus metropolis Rhufina. hinc fluvius Dobona, ac deinde Vodiæ cum
promuntorio ejusdem nominis, quod promuntorio Albionis Antivestæo
obvertitur, distans inde milliaribus CXXXXV. non procul inde Dabrona
fluvius Brigantum regionis terminus, qui fines regionis fluvium Brigas
& urbem habebant Brigantiam.

XIV. Pars hujus insulæ, à Sacro promuntorio ad Rhobogdium usque
extensa, Orientalis censetur. habitantes supra promuntorium Sacrum
Menapii, primariam habebant ejusdem nominis urbem ad fluvium Modonam.
hinc ad Menapiam, in Dimetia sitam, XXX. milliaria numerantur, ut
Plinius refert. harum unam, quam nam verò incertum, patriam habebat
Carausius. ultra harum terminos metropolin Dunum habebant Cauci, quorum
fines alluebat fluvius Oboca. Teutonicæ binas has nationes originis
esse extra dubium est. incertum verò quo tempore primùm in has terras
eorum majores trajecerint. brevi ante Cæsaris in Brittaniam transitum
id contigisse maxumè videtur probabile.

XV. Eblanæ ulterius habitabant, primariam verò ad Lœbium flumen
habentes Mediolanum. Septentrionali viciniores Voluntii civitatem
habebant Lebarum, fluvios autem Vinderum & Buvindam. superiorem his
insulæ partem, Rhobogdiis affinem, tenebant Damnii, his urbium caput
Dunum, ubi sepulti creduntur D. Patricius, D. Columba & D. Brigitta,
eodem tumulo reconditi.

XVI. Restat jam, ut eorum, qui interiorem hujus insulæ partem
habitabant, populorum mentio injiciatur. contermini Caucis & Menapiis,
supra Brigantes autem, incolebant Coriondii, reliquam insulæ partem
Scotti habebant, quibus Scotiæ nomen tota exinde debet. plures inter,
quas illi habebant. civitates præ cæteris innotuerunt tantum duæ,
quarum ad nos pervenit memoria. altera Rheba ad flumen & lacum Rhebium,
Ibernia altera, sita ad orientale Seni fluminis latus.

XVII. Non possum non hoc loco monere Damnios, Voluntios, Brigantes, &
Cangianos omnes fuisse Brittanicæ originis nationes, quæ, cum vel ab
hoste finitimo non daretur quies, vel tot tantaque exigerentur tributa,
quibus solvendis se impares intelligerent, sensim, novas quæsituræ
sedes, in hanc terram trajecerant. dictum jam antea de Menapiis,
Chaucis, nec de iis, quæ offeruntur ulterius, plura occurrunt, quibus
tutò fides potest haberi. refert quidem, Augustæ historiæ scriptor,
Tacitus, quod pluribus, quam Albion, peregrinis Hybernia fuerit
frequentata. at, si res ita revera se habuisset, vix dubitandum
videtur, plura nobis de statu Hyberniæ & fide digniora Veteres fuisse
relicturos. relicturoque jam michi descriptionem Hyberniæ non abs re
fore videtur docere, hanc, non armis, sed metu tantum sub Romanorum
redactam fuisse imperium. quin potius Regem Ptolemæum in secunda
Europæ tabula, aliosque veterum inclutissimorum geographorum in situ
illius delineando errasse, utpote qui hanc non solum justo longius
à Brittania, sed etiam prorsus à parte boreali provinciæ Secundæ,
statuerunt; id quorum ex ipsorum libris & Tabulis huc spectantibus
patet abunde.

XVIII. Super Hyberniam sitæ erant Hebudes, V. numero, quarum incolæ
nesciunt fruges, piscibus tantum & lacte viventes. Rex unus est, ut
scribit Solinus, universis. nam quotquot sunt, omnes angusto interluvio
dividuntur. ille Rex nichil suum habebat, omnia universorum. ad
æquitatem certis legibus adstringitur, ac, ne avaritia à vero rectoque
eum seduceret, discebat ex paupertate justitiam, utpote cui nichil
esset rei familiaris, verum alitur è publico. nulla illi dabatur fœmina
propria, sed per vicissitudines, in quamcunque commotus fuisset, sibi
vendicat usurariam, unde ei nec votum, nec spes conceditur liberorum.
de Hebudibus hisce nonnulli scripserunt. dies continuos XXX. sub bruma
esse noctem, sed Dictator Cæsar nichil de eo, studiose licet inquirens,
reperiebat, nisi, quod certis ex aqua mensuris breviores fuisse noctes
quam in Gallia intellexerit.

XIX. Secundam à continenti stationem Orcades præbent, quæ ab Hebudibus
porrò, sed erroneè, sunt VII. dierum totidemque noctium cursu,
ut scripserunt nonnulli, numero XXX, angustis inter sese deductæ
spatiis, vacabant homine, non habebant sylvas, tantum junceis herbis
horrescentes. cætera earum nil nisi arenæ & rupes tenent, ut ego, ex
Solino cum aliis colligi posse, habeo persuasum.

XX. Thule ultima omnium, quæ Brittanicæ vocantur, Belgarum littori
apposita statuitur à Mela. Græcis Romanisque celebrata carminibus, de
quo Homerus Mantuanus:

    ——_& tibi serviat ultima Thule._

in ea solstitiô nullas esse noctes indicavimus, cancri signum Sole
transeunte, ut author est Plinius, nullosque contra per brumam dies,
hæc quidem senis mensibus continuis fieri arbitrantur, qui hic
habitant, ut refert Solinus, principio veris inter pecudes pabulis
vivunt, deinde lacte, in hyemem conferunt arborum fructus. utuntur
fœminis vulgo, certum matrimonium nullis. Thule autem larga & diutinâ
pomonâ copiosa est, ut tradit idem author. ultra Thulen unius diei
navigatione accepimus pigrum esse & concretum mare, à nonnullis Cronium
appellatur. à Thule in Caledoniam bidui navigatio est.

XXI. Thanatos insula alluitur freto Oceani, à Brittaniæ continente
æstuario tenui, Wantsuam dicto, separata, frumentariis campis felix,
& gleba uberi, nec tantum sibi soli, verum & aliis salubribus locis,
ut author est Isidorus, cum ipsa nullo serpatur angue, asportata inde
terra, quoquò gentium invecta sit, angues necat. hæc non longe abest à
Rhutupi sita.

XXII. Vecta, à Vespasiano devicta olim, insula est, proximum Belgis
habet ab oriente in occasum XXX. circitur millia passuum, ab austro
in boream XII. in orientalibus suis partibus mari VI. millium, in
occidentalibus III. à meridionali supra scripto littore distans.

XXIII. Præter supradictas insulas fuerunt etiam VII. Acmodæ, Ricnea,
Silimnus, Andros, Sigdiles XL. Vindilios, Sarna, Cæsarea & Cassiterides.

XXIV. Sena, Ossismicis adversa littoribus, Gallici Numinis oraculo
insignis est, ut author est Mela. cujus antistites, perpetua
virginitate sanctæ, numero IX. esse traduntur, Senas Galli vocant,
putantque ingeniis singularibus præditas, maria ac ventos concitare
carminibus, seque in quæ velint animalia vertere, sanare quæ apud
alios insanabilia sunt. scire ventura & prædicere. sed non nisi deditæ
navigantibus, & ob id tantum ut se consulerent eò profectis.

XXV. Reliquæ Albioni circumfusæ minoris peripheriæ & momenti insulæ
ex depictæ adjectæque mappæ inspectione melius, quam ex nudo quodam
recensu, censeri ac dignosci possunt. heic itaque subsisto meumque
his rebus locatum studium Benevolo Lectori ejusque favori & judicio
studiose commendo.

1   In supplementum datæ hucusque Brittaniæ antiquæ descriptionis

2   I. Chronologiæ, à prima inde orbis origine ad vastata à Gothis
    Roman deductæ, epitomen. &

    præfuerant brevem recensum.

3   Dicant fortè nonnulli potuisse istiusmodi operam, utpote non

    ut tamen nichil propterea sacro cultui decedat. sin verò Momus

                               CAPUT I.

4   In principio mundum, nobis hodiernum reliquisque creaturis
    habitatum, VI. dierum spatio ex nihilo condidit omnipotens Creator.

5   _Anno Mundi_ MDCLVI. Crescentem continuo usu humani generis
    malitiam vindicaturus Creator diluvium Orbi immisit, quod totum
    obruens mundum omnem delevit viventium ordinem, solis, quæ arcam
    intraverant, exceptis & servatis, quorum deinceps propago novis
    animalium colonis novum orbem replevit.

6   _A. M._ MMM. Circa hæc tempora cultam & habitatam primùm Brittaniam
    arbitrantur nonnulli, cum illam salutarent Græci Phœnicesque
    mercatores. nec desunt, qui à Rege quodam Brytone non diu postea
    conditum credunt Londinium.

7   _A. M._ MMMCCXXVIII. Prima urbis Romæ, quæ gentium exinde communis
    terror, fundamenta posuerunt fratres Romulus & Remus.

8   _A. M._ MMMDC. Egressi è Brittania per Galliam Senones Italiam
    invasere, Romam oppugnaturi.

9   _A. M._ MMMDCL. Has terras intrarunt Belgæ, Celtæque desertam à
    Senonibus regionem occuparunt. non diu postea cum exercitu in hoc
    regnum transiit Rex Æduorum Divitiacus, magnamque ejus partem
    subegit. circa hæc tempora in Hyberniam commigrarunt, ejecti à
    Belgis Brittones, ibique sedes posuerunt, ex illo tempore Scotti
    appellati.

10  _A. M._ MMMDCCCCXLIII. Gestum est Cassibelini cum civitatibus
    maritimis bellum.

11  _A. M._ MMMDCCCCXLVI. Cæsar Germanos & Gallos capit, & Brittones
    quoque, quibus ante eum ne nomen quidem Romanorum cognitum fuerat,
    victor, obsidibus acceptis, stipendarios facit.

12  _A. M._ MMMDCCCCXLVII. Denuo in has terras profectus bellum gessit
    cum Rege Cassiorum Cassibelino, invitatus, ut ipse quidem prætendit,
    à Trinobantibus. sed, quod majore veri specie tradit Suetonius,
    potius avaritiem ipsius sollicitantibus prætiosis Brittaniæ
    margaritis.

13  _A. M._ MMMMXLIV. Ipse in Brittaniam profectus Imperator Claudius,
    semestri spatio, absque ulla vi aut sanguinis effusione, magnam
    insulæ partem in suam redegit potestatem, quam exinde Cæsariensem
    jussit vocari.

14  _A. M._ MMMMXLV. Missus ab Imperatore Claudio cum II. Legione in has
    terras Vespasianus, adhuc in privata vita, Belgas Damnoniosque
    oppugnavit, tandemque, commissis prœliis XXXII. urbibus XX.
    expugnatis, sub obsequium Romani Imperii redegit, una cum insula
    Vecta.

15  _A. M._ MMMMXLVII. Thermas & Glebon occupaverunt Romani.

16  _A. M._ MMMML. Post novennale bellum Regem Silurum Charaticum vicit
    Dux Romanorum Ostorius, magna Brittaniæ pars in formam provinciæ
    redacta, & Camalodunensis coloniæ posita fundamenta.

17  _A. M._ MMMMLII. Cogibundo urbes quædam apud Belgas à Romanis
    concessæ, ut inde sibi conderet Regnum. circa hæc tempora, relictâ
    Brittaniâ, Cangi & Brigantes in Hyberniam commigrarunt sedesque ibi
    posuerunt.

18  _A. M._ MMMMLXI. Nero Imperator, in re militari nichil omnino ausus,
    Brittaniam pene amisit. nam duo sub illo nobilissima oppida illic
    capta atque eversa sunt. nam insurrexit contra Romanos Bondvica,
    illatam sibi à Romanis injuriam vindicatura, colonias illas
    Romanorum, Londinium, Camalodunum & municipium Verulamium igne
    delevit, occisis ultra octoginta millibus civium Romanorum. superata
    illa, tandem à Suetonio, qui acerrime illatum Romanis damnum
    vindicavit, occiso subditorum ejus æquali numero.

19  _A. M._ MMMMLXXIII. Brigantes vicit Cerealis.

20  _A. M._ MMMMLXXVI. Ordovices plectit Frontinus.

21  _A. M._ MMMMLXXX. Magnum cum Rege Caledoniorum Galgaco prœlium
    committit Agricola, eoque devicto, totam insulam cum classe
    lustrari jubet, maritimamque ipsius oram totus obiens, Orcades
    submittit Imperio Romano.

22  _A. M._ MMMMCXX. Ipse in Brittaniam transit Hadrianus Imperator,
    immensoque muro unam insulæ partem ab altera sejungit.

23  _A. M._ MMMMCXL. Missus ab Antonino Pio Urbicus victoriis
    inclarescit.

24  _A. M._ MMMMCL. Nonnullos quoque à Brittanis victorias reportat
    Aurelius Antoninus.

25  _A. M._ MMMMCLX. Luce Christianismi, regnante Lucio Rege,
    collustratur Brittania, Rege Cruci Christi se primùm submittente.

26  _A. M._ MMMMCLXX. Provincia Vespasiana ejiciuntur Romani. hoc
    circiter tempore ex insulis in Brittaniam cum Pictis suis
    advenisse creditur Reuda Rex.

27  _A. M._ MMMMCCVII. Destructum, à Romanis conditum, murum restituit
    transiens in Brittaniam Severus Imperator, & non diu post Eboraci,
    manu Dei, moritur.

28  _A. M._ MMMMCCXI. Venalem à Mæatis pacem obtinuit Bassianus.

29  _A. M._ MMMMCCXX. Per hæc tempora intra mœnia se continent Romani
    milites, altâque pace tota perfruitur insula.

30  _A. M._ MMMMCCXC. Carausius, sumpta purpurâ, Brittanias occupavit,
    post X. annos per Asclopiodorum Brittania recepta.

31  _A. M._ MMMMCCCIIII. Persecutio crudelis & crebra flagrabat, ut
    intra unum mensem XVII. millia Martyrum pro Christo passa
    inveniantur, quæ & Oceani limbum transgressa Albanum, Aaron, &
    Julium Brittones cum aliis pluribus viris & fœminis felici cruore
    damnavit.

32  _A. M._ MMMMCCCLVI. Constantius, XVI. imperii anno, summæ
    mansuetudinis & civilitatis vir, victô Alectô, in Brittania diem
    obiit Eboraci.

33  _A. M._ MMMMCCCVII. Constantius, qui Magnus postea dicitur,
    Constantii ex Brittanica Helena filius, in Brittaniis creatus
    Imperator, cui se sponte tributariam offert Hyberniam.

34  _A. M._ MMMMCCCXX. Ductu Regis Fergusii in Brittaniam transeunt
    Scotti, ibique sedem figunt.

35  _A. M._ MMMMCCCLXXXV. Theodosius Maximum tyrannum III. ab Aquileia
    lapide interfecit. qui, quoniam Brittaniam omni pene armata
    juventute copiisque spoliaverat militaribus, quæ, tyrannidis ejus
    vestigia secutæ in Gallias, nunquam ultra domum rediere, videntes,
    transmarinæ gentes sævissimæ, Scottorum à circio, Pictorum ab
    aquilone, destitutam milite ac defensore insulam, adveniunt, &
    vastatam direptamque eam multos per annos opprimunt.

36  _A. M._ MMMMCCCXCVI. Brittones Scottorum, Pictorumque infestationem
    non ferentes, Romam mittunt, &, sui subjectione promissa, contra
    hostem auxilia flagitant, quibus statim missa legio magnam
    Barbarorum multitudinem sternit, cæteros Brittaniæ finibus pellit,
    ac, domum reversura, præcepit sociis, ad arcendos hostes, murum
    trans insulam inter duo æstuaria statuere. qui, absque artifice
    magistro magis cespite quam lapide factus, nil operantibus profuit.
    nam mox, ut discessere Romani, advectus navibus prior hostis, quasi
    maturam segetem, obvia quæque sibi cædit, calcat, devorat.

37  _A. M._ MMMMCCCC. Iterum petiti auxilia Romani advolant & cæsum
    hostem trans maria fugant conjunctis sibi Brittonibus, murum non
    terra, ut ante pulvereum, sed saxo solidum, inter civitatis,
    quæ ibidem ob metum hostium fuerunt factæ, à mari usque ad mare
    collocant. sed & in littore meridiano maris, quia & inde hostis
    Saxonicus timebatur, turres per intervalla ad prospectum maris
    statuunt. id Stilichontis erat opus, ut ex his Claudiani versibus
    constat:

        ——————_Caledonio velata Brittania monstro,
        Ferro Picta genas, cujus vestigia verrit
        Cærulus, Oceanique æstum mentitur, amictus:
        Me quoque vicinis pereuntem gentibus, inquit,
        Munivit Stilicho, totam cum Scottus Hybernam
        Movit, & infesto spumavit remige Thetys.
        Illius effectum curis, nec bella timerem
        Scotica ne Pictum tremerem, ne littore toto
        Prospicerem dubiis venturum Saxona ventis._

38  _A. M._ MMMMCCCCXI. Occupata à Gothis est Roma, sedes quartæ &
    maxumæ Monarchiarum, de quibus Daniel fuerat vaticinatus, anno
    milesimo centesimo sexagesimo quarto suæ conditionis. ex quo autem
    tempore Romani in Brittania regnare cessarunt, post annos ferme
    CCCCLXV. ex quo Julius Cæsar eandem insulam adiit.

39  _A. M._ MMMMCCCCXLVI. Recedente à Brittaniis legione Romana, cognita
    Scotti & Picti reditus denegatione, redeunt ipsi, & totam ab
    aquilone insulam pro indigenis muro tenus capescunt nec mora, cæsis,
    captis, fugatisque custodibus muri & ipso interrupto, etiam intra
    illum crudelis prædo grassatur. mittitur epistola lachrymis
    ærumnisque referta ad Romanæ potestatis virum Fl. Ætium, ter
    consulem, vicesimo tertio Theodosii Principis anno petens auxilium,
    nec impetrat.


                               CAPUT II.

Veritatem, quoad fieri licuit, sectatus fui, si quid occurrat fortè,
illi non exactè congruum, illud michi ne imputetur vitióve vertatur
rogo. me enim ad regulas legesque Historiæ sollicitè componens, ea bona
fide collegi aliorum verba et relationes, quæ sincera maxumè deprehendi
& fide dignissima. ad cætera præter Elenchum Imperatorum Legatorumque
Romanorum, qui huic insulæ cum imperio præfuerunt, amplius quidquam
expectare nolit Lector, quocúmque meum opus finiam.

II. Igitur, primus omnium Romanorum Dictator Julius cum exercitu,
principatu Cassibellino, Brittaniam ingressus, quamquam prospera pugna
terruerit incolas, ut Tacitus refert, ac littore potitus sit, potest
videri ostendisse posteris, non tradidisse.

III. Mox bella civilia, & in rempublicam versa principum arma, ac
longa oblivio Brittaniæ etiam in pace. consilium id Augustus vocabat,
Tiberius præceptum. agitasse Caligulam de intranda Brittania satis
constat, ni velox ingenio, mobilisque pœnitentia, & ingentes adversus
Germaniam conatus frustra fuissent.

IV. Claudius verò Brittaniæ intulit bellum, quam nullus Romanorum
post Julium Cæsarem attigerat, transvectis legionibus auxiliisque,
sine ullo prœlio ac sanguine, intra paucissimos dies partem insulæ in
ditionem recepit. deinde misit Vespasianum, adhuc in privata vita, qui
tricies & bis cum hoste conflixit. duas validissimas gentes cum Regibus
eorum, XX. oppida & insulam Vectem, Brittaniæ proximam, imperio Romano
adjecit. reliquas devicit per Cnæum Sentium & Aulum Plautium, illustres
& nobiles viros, & triumphum celebrem egit.

V. Subinde Ostorius Scapula, vir bello egregius, qui in formam
provinciæ proximam partem Brittaniæ redegit. addita insuper veteranorum
colonia Camalodunum. quædam civitates Cogiduno Regi donatæ. is ad
Trajani usque Principatum fidelissimus mansit, ut Tacitus scribit.

VI. Mox Avitus Didius Gallus parta à prioribus continuit, paucis
admodum castellis in ulteriora permotis, per quæ fama aucti officii
quæreretur.

VII. Didium Verannius excepit, isque intra annum exstinctus est.

VIII. Suetonius hinc Paulinus biennio prosperas res habuit, subactis
nationibus, firmatisque præsidiis, quorum fiducia Monam insulam, ut
vires rebellibus ministrantem, aggressus terga occasioni patefecit.
namque Legati absentiâ remoto metu Brittones accendere, atque Bonduica,
generis Regii fœmina, duce, sumpsere universi bellum; ac sparsos per
castella milites consectati, expugnatis præsidiis, ipsam coloniam
invasere, ut sedem servitutis, nec ullum in barbaris sævitiæ genus
omisit ira & victoria. quod, nisi Paulinus, eo cognito provinciæ motu
prosperè subvenisset amissa Brittania foret, quam unius prœlii fortuna
veteri patientiæ restituit. tenentibus arma plerisque, quos conscientia
defectionis, & proprius ex Legato timor agitabat.

IX. Hic cum egregius cætera, arrogantes in deditos & ut suæ quoque
injuriæ ultor. durius consuleret; missus Petronius Turpilianus tanquam
exorabilior & delictis hostium novus, eoque pœnitentiæ mitior,
compositis prioribus, nichil ultra ausus, Trebellio Maximo provinciam
tradidit.

X. Trebellius segnior & nullis castrorum experimentis, comitate quadam
curandi, provinciam tenuit. Didicere jam barbari quoque Brittones
ignoscere vitiis blandientibus. & interventus civilium armorum, præbuit
justam segnitiæ excusationem. sed discordia laboratum, cum assuetus
expeditionibus miles otio lasciviret. Trebellius fuga ac latebris
vitata exercitus ira, indecorus atque humilis, præcariò mox præfuit,
ac velut pacti, exercitus licentiam, Dux salutem. hæc seditio sine
sanguine stetit.

XI. Nec Vectius Bolanus manentibus adhuc civilibus bellis agitavit
Brittaniam disciplina. eadem inertia erga hostes similis petulantia
castrorum: nisi quod innocens Bolanus & nullis delictis invisus
charitatem peraverat loco authoritatis.

XII. Sed ubi cum cætero Orbe, Vespasianus & Brittaniam recuperavit,
magni Duces, egregii exercitus, minuta hostium spes: & terrorem statim
intulit Petilius Cerealis, Brigantum civitatem, quæ numerosissima
provinciæ totius perhibetur, aggressus. multa prœlia & aliquando non
incruenta: magnamque Brigantum partem aut victoria amplexus, aut bello.

XIII. Sed cum Cerealis quidem alterius successoris curam famamque
obruisset, sustinuit quoque molem Julius Frontinus, vir magnus quantum
licebat, validamque & pugnacem Silurum gentem armis subegit; super
virtutem hostium locorum quoque difficultates eluctatus.

XIV. Successit huic Agricola, qui non solum acquisitam provinciæ pacem
constituit, sed etiam annos septem plus minus continuis Caledonios,
cum bellocissimo Rege ipsorum Galgaco, debellavit. quo facto Romanorum
ditioni gentes non antea cognitas adjunxit.

XV. Majorem verò Agricolæ gloriam invidens Domitianus, domum eum
revocavit, Legatumque suum Lucullum in Brittanias misit, quod lanceas
novæ formæ appellari Lucculeas passus esset.

XVI. Successor ejus Trebellius erat, sub quo duæ provinciæ, Vespasiana
scilicet & Maæta, fractæ sunt. Romani se ipsos autem luxuriæ dederunt.

XVII. Circa idem tempus insulam hancce visitans Hadrianus Imperator
murum, opus sane mirandum & maxume memorabile, erexit, Juliumque
Severum Legatum in Brittaniis reliquit.

XVIII. Postea nichil unquam notatu dignum audivimus esse perpetratum,
donec Antoninus Pius per Legatos suos plurima bella gessit, nam &
Brittones, per Lollium Urbicum Proprætorem & Saturninum Præfectum
classis, vicit, alio muro, submotis barbaris, ducto. provinciam, postea
Valentiæ nomine notam, revocavit.

XIX. Pio Mortuô, varias de Brittonibus, Germanisque victorias
reportavit Aurelius Antoninus.

XX. Mortuô autem Antoninô, cum ea quæ Romanis ademerant satis non
haberent, magnam à Legato Marcello passi sunt cladem.

XXI. Hic Pertinacem habuit successorem, qui fortem quoque se gessit
ducem.

XXII. Hunc excepit Clodius Albinus, qui de sceptro & purpura cum Severo
contendit.

XXIII. Post hos primus erat Virius Lupus, qui Legati nomine gaudebat.
non huic multa præclara gesta adscribuntur, quippe cujus gloriam
intercepit invictissimus Severus, qui, fugatis celeritur hostibus,
murum Hadrianum, nunc ruinosum, ad summam ejus perfectionem reparavit;
&, si vixerat, proposuerat exstirpare barbaros, quibus erat infestus,
cum eorum nomine, ex hacce insula, sed obiit, manu Dei, apud Brigantes
in municipio Eboraco.

XXIV. Ejusque in locum subiit Alexander, qui orientis quasdam victorias
reportavit, in Edissa mortuus.
                                                              _Sicilia._

                             An ACCOUNT of
                       RICHARD +OF+ CIRENCESTER,
                         MONK of WESTMINSTER,
                           And of his Works:
                With his Ancient MAP of ROMAN BRITAIN,
                     And the +Itinerary+ thereof.
          Read at the +Antiquarian Society+, March 18, 1756.




                                  I.

       _To the Right Honourable the Lord_ WILUGHBY _of_ Parham,
                _President of the_ Antiquarian Society.

The love I had for my own country, in my younger days, prompted me
to visit many parts of it, and to refuse great offers made me to go
into foreign and fashionable tours. I was sensible we abounded at home
with extraordinary curiosities, and things remarkable, both in art and
nature; as well as most valuable antiquities in all kinds, most worthy
of our regard, and which it most became us to take cognisance of.

These considerations might perhaps induce me to be too hasty in
publishing my juvenile work in this kind of learning, _Itinerarium
Curiosum_, chiefly with a view to point out a way and method of
inquiry, and to render this study both useful and entertaining.

The more readily, therefore, I can excuse myself, in regard to
imperfections in that work, as I had not sight of our author’s
treatise, Richard of Cirencester, at that time absolutely unknown.

Since, then, I have had the good fortune to save this most invaluable
work of his, I could not refrain from contributing somewhat toward
giving an account of it, and of its author. I gladly address it to
your Lordship, who worthily preside over the Antiquarian Society. I am
sensible your Lordship is animated with a like spirit in favour of your
country, and of your country antiquities.

I propose therefore briefly to recite,

I. What memoirs we can recover, concerning our author and his writings,
with the occasion and manner of finding out and saving the manuscript.

II. I shall give an account of the map prefixed to the present
treatise, which I copied from that of our author; giving it the
advantage of the present geographical direction. I shall exhibit an
alphabetical index of all the places mentioned in it, with the modern
names annexed.

III. A transcript of his most curious Itinerary; with an alphabetical
index, all along aligning the present names of the places, according to
the best of my judgement. This is the last help we must expect, toward
finding out the Roman Names of places in Britain.

I. Let us inquire, who our Richard of Cirencester was: and it will be
regular to declare who he was not.

He has often been confounded with a Richard, a monk of Westminster, a
writer who lived a good deal after our author. This latter Richard was
a Devonshire man, cited by Risdon, in his description of that country;
by Antony Wood, from Pitse’s manuscript, p. 462; by Fuller, book I. in
his Worthies, p. 263; by Bale, V. 87; by bishop Tanner, who repeats
this; all erroneously.

My learned friend, the reverend Mr. Widmore, librarian to Westminster
Abbey, deserves public thanks for his inquiries, which he made at my
request. In perusing the Abbey rolls diligently, he finds, that he
was Richard, a monk of Westminster, admitted, in 1450, a member of
that religious foundation: that he continued there till 1472. The roll
beyond that time is defective.

But our author (Richard of Cirencester)’s name first appears on
the chamberlain’s list of the monks of Westminster, by the name
_Circestre_, in 1355. 30 Ed. III.

In 1387, he is witness in a parchment deed, by the name of _Richardo
Cirencestre confrater_.

1397, in the chamberlain’s list, mentioned again _R. Cirencester_.

1399, _Ric. Cirencestre_.

1400, he was in the Abbey infirmary, and died in that or the next year.
The place of his interment, questionless, is in the Abbey cloisters.

What is more particularly to be remarked, is this. In the year 1391,
14 R. II. he obtained a licence of the abbot, to go to Rome. This, no
doubt, he performed between that and the year 1397.

Thus bishop Nicolson, in his English historical library, p. 65. “Nor
have I any more to say, of _Richard of Chichester_ (he means our
_Cirencester_) than what John Pitts has told me, fol. 438, that he was
a monk of Westminster, A. D. 1348; that he travelled to most of the
libraries in England, and out of his collections thence, compiled a
notable history of this kingdom, from the coming in of the Saxons, down
to his own time.

“But it seems (says the bishop) he treated too of much higher times.”

Hence we gather an exact idea of our author’s genius; a lover of
learning, a lover of his country; which he studied to adorn. We learn
his indefatigable diligence, in search of what might contribute to
its history. He travelled all over England, to study in the monastic
libraries: his eager thirst prompted him to visit Rome; and he probably
spent some years there. But his chief attention was to the history of
his own country.

It will give you pleasure to read the original licence, still preserved
in the archives of the Abbey, as Mr. Widmore transcribed it, omitting
the contractions.

The abbot here is William de Colcestre, created 1386. —— de Litlyngton
preceded him; in whose time our Richard was admitted into the Abbey,
above thirty years ago.

Observe we, in his chorography of Britain he is a little more
particular upon Cirencester; as a genius is naturally inclined to show
regard to the place of his nativity.

_Et cui reliquæ (urbes) nomen, laudemque debent, Corinum; urbs
perspicabilis: Opus, ut tradunt, Vespasiani Ducis._

Again, we may believe, Richard was of a good family, and had a fortune
of his own, to support the charge of travelling.

Hence we need not wonder to see the produce of his eager thirst in
learning. He was not content to write the transactions in his own
convent, or of those of his own time, but penetrated far and deep in
his researches: for we shall find, that he wrote the English history
to his own time; the Saxon history complete; above that, the British
history, from the time the Romans left us: and, to crown all, we learn
from the present work, now happily preserved, the completest account
of the Roman state of Britain, and of the most ancient inhabitants
thereof; and the geography thereof admirably depicted in a most
excellent map.

Such was this truly great man, Richard of Cirencester! What was his
family, name, and origin, we know not: but it was the fashion of the
ecclesiastics of those days, and so down to Henry the VIIIth’s time, to
take local names from the place of their nativity; probably, as more
honourable: for most of the names then were what we call _sobriquets_,
travelling names; a custom learnt from the expeditions into the Holy
Land; what we call _nick-names_: for instance, some were taken from
offices, as _pope_, _bishop_, _priest_, _deacon_; some from animals, as
_bull_, _doe_, _hog_, some from birds, as _bat_, _kite_, _peacock_;
some from fishes, as _salmon_, _herring_, _pike_; some diminutive names
of mere contempt, as _peasecod_, _scattergood_, _mist_, _farthing_; and
the very family-royal, the celebrated _Plantagenet_, means no more than
_broomstick_.

                   *       *       *       *       *

But, to leave this, we will recite what we find of our author’s works.

Thus Gerard John Vossius, _de historicis Latinis_, L. III. quarto, p.
532, englished: “About the year 1340, lived Richard of Cirencester, an
Englishman, monk of Westminster, Benedictine. He used much industry in
compiling the history of the Anglo-Saxons, in five books of _Chronica_:
that work begins from the arrival of Hengist the Saxon into Britain,
A. D. 448. thence, through a series of nine centuries, he ends at the
year 1348, 32 Ed. III. and this work is divided into two. The first
part begins,”

_Post primum Insulæ Brittaniæ regem_, &c. This is called by the author
_Speculum historiale_, and contains four books.

The other part is called _Anglo-Saxonum Chronicon_, L. V. is a
continuation of the former part, _Prudentiæ Veterum mos inolevit_—it
was John Stow’s, says a manuscript note of Joscelin, in a manuscript in
the Cotton library, _Nero_ C. iii. A manuscript of both parts is found
in the public library, Cambridge, among the manuscripts, fol. contains
pages 516, and four books; ends in 1066. (248.) in the catalogue of
manuscripts mentioned p. 168, Nᵒ 2304. (124.) It begins,

_Brittannia insularum optima_, &c. in the end (says Dr. James,
librarian in A.D. 1600.) are these words,

_Reges vero Saxonum Gulielmo Malmsburiensi et Henrico Huntendoniensi
permitto: quos de regibus Britonum tacere jubeo_, &c.

Vossius says, there is in Bennet-College library, Cambridge, a
manuscript _epitome Chronicorum_, which acknowledges our Richard for
its author, in the title.

There is in the Arundel library of the Royal Society, among the
manuscripts, p. 137, mentioned this. _Britonum, Anglorum et Saxonum
historia_, to the reign of Hen. III. said to be of this author.

Dr. Stanley, in his catalogue of the manuscripts in Bennet-College
library aforesaid, p. 22. G. VIII. mentions this. _Ricardi Cicestrii
Speculum historiale, vel Anglo-Saxonum Chronicon, ab anno 449. ad_ H.
III.

In the printed catalogue of manuscripts, p. 134. Nᵒ 1343. (66.)
_Epitome Chronicorum Angliæ_, L. 1, 2. _Epitome Chronicorum Ric. Cic.
Monachi Westmonasterii_.

There is a work of our Richard’s in the Lambeth library, among the
Wharton manuscripts, L. p. 59. and the late Dr. Richard Rawlinson
bought a manuscript of his, at Sir Joseph Jekyl’s sale; which is now at
Oxford.

Our author was not eminent solely in this kind of learning; but we find
likewise the traces of other works of his, in his clerical character.
Thus, in a volume of St. Jerom’s _ad Eugenium_, 19. 9. a manuscript in
Bennet-College library, is mention of _Tractatus mag. magistri Ricardi
Cirencestre, super symbolum majus et minus_.

There is likewise, in the library of Peterburgh, T. IV. a work of his,
_de Officiis Ecclesiasticis_, L. VII. begins _Officium ut_—This is
mentioned by William Wydeford, and attributed to our Richard, in his
determination against the trialogue of Wicliff, artic. 1. fol. 96.
likewise by Richard Wych, who says he flourished A. D. 1348.

Thus much we have to say concerning our author’s life and works. But
let us reflect on what Dr. Nicolson says, in reciting what he had wrote
of the Saxon history; adding, _but it seems, he treated too of much
higher times_. Here he must at least mean his British history, or that
from the time of the Romans; and perhaps that description of Roman
Britain, which we are now treating off: but what reasons were suggested
to him about it, we cannot guess; and in our manuscript we observe
it begins with p. xxii. as appears from a scrip I desired my friend
Bertram to send me, of the manner of the writing: therefore some other
work of our Richard’s was probably contained in those 22 pages.

However these matters may have been, we must justly admire our author’s
great capacity, in compiling the history of his country from first to
last, as far as he could gather it, from all the materials then to be
found in all the considerable libraries in England, and what he could
likewise find to his purpose in foreign parts. Whether he found our map
and manuscript in our monastic libraries at home, or in the Vatican,
or elsewhere abroad, we cannot determine: he himself gives us no other
light in the case, than that it was compiled from memoirs _a quodam
Duce Romano consignatis, et posteritati relictis_, which I am persuaded
is no other than Agricola, under Domitian.

But, above all, we have reason to congratulate ourselves, that the
present work of his is happily rescued from oblivion, and, most likely,
from an absolute destruction.

I shall now concisely recite the history of its discovery.

                   *       *       *       *       *

In the summer of 1747, June 11, whilst I lived at Stamford, I received
a letter from Charles Julius Bertram, professor of the English tongue
in the Royal Marine Academy of Copenhagen, a person unknown to me.
The letter was polite, full of compliments, as usual with foreigners,
expressing much candor and respect to me; being only acquainted with
some works of mine published: the letter was dated the year before; for
all that time he hesitated in sending it.

Soon after my receiving it, I sent a civil answer; which produced
another letter, with a prolix and elaborate Latin epistle inclosed,
from the famous Mr. Gramm, privy-counsellor and chief librarian to
his Danish Majesty; a learned gentleman, who had been in England, and
visited our universities. (Mr. Martin Folkes remembered him.) He was
Mr. Bertram’s great friend and patron.

I answered that letter, and it created a correspondence between us.
Among other matters, Mr. Bertram mentioned a manuscript, in a friend’s
hands, of Richard of Westminster, being a history of Roman Britain,
which he thought a great curiosity; and an ancient map of the island
annexed.

In November, that year, the Duke of Montagu, who was pleased to have
a favor for me, drew me from a beloved retirement, where I proposed
to spend the remainder of my life; therefore wondered the more,
how Mr. Bertram found me out: nor was I sollicitous about Richard
of Westminster, as he then called him, till I was presented to St.
George’s church, Queen-square. When I became fixed in London, I thought
it proper to cultivate my Copenhagen correspondence; and I received
another Latin Letter from Mr. Gramm; and soon after, an account of his
death, and a print of him in profile.

I now began to think of the manuscript, and desired some little extract
from it; then, an imitation of the hand-writing, which I showed to my
late friend Mr. Casley, keeper in the Cotton library, who immediately
pronounced it to be 400 years old.

I pressed Mr. Bertram to get the manuscript into his hands, if
possible; which at length, with some difficulty, he accomplished; and,
on my sollicitation, sent to me in letters a transcript of the whole;
and at last a copy of the map, he having an excellent hand in drawing.

Upon perusal, I seriously sollicited him to print it, as the greatest
treasure we now can boast of in this kind of learning. In the mean
time, I have here extracted some account of the Treatise, for your
present entertainment, as I gave it to Dr. Mead, and to my very worthy
friend Mr. Gray of Colchester, some time past, at their request.


   _Ricardi monachi Westmonasteriensis commentariolum geographicum,
       de situ Brittaniæ, et stationum quas in ea insula Romani
                            ædificaverunt._

Cap. I. Of the name and situation of the island.

Cap. II. Of the measure. He quotes Virgil, Agrippa, Marcianus, Livy,
Fabius Rusticus, Tacitus, Ptolemy, Cæsar, Mela, Bede.

Cap. III. Of the inhabitants; their origin: he mentions reports
of Hercules coming hither. Of their manners; chiefly from Cæsar’s
Commentaries. Of the military of the Britons; chiefly from Cæsar’s
Commentaries.

Cap. IV. Of the Druids authority and religion: in time of invasion all
the princes chose a Dictator to command: chiefly from Cæsar.

Cap. V. Of the fertility of Britain, its metals, &c.

Cap. VI. Of the division of the island into seven provinces; Britannia
Prima, Secunda, Flavia, Maxima, Valentia, and Vespasiana: these were
all under the Roman power. Caledonia is additional to the former, being
the north-west part of Scotland, the highlands, beyond Inverness. We
never had a true notion of the division of these provinces before, nor
that the Romans possessed all the country to Inverness.

                   *       *       *       *       *

This chapter is very long: but as to the matter of it, it is an
invaluable curiosity to the inquirers into Roman Britain. He gives us
an exact and copious chorography of the whole island; its boundaries,
rivers, mountains, promontories, roads, nations, cities, and towns,
in the time of the Romans. It is accompanied with an accurate map of
_faciei Romanæ_, as the author terms it.

He gives us more than a hundred names of cities, roads, people, and the
like; which till now were absolutely unknown to us: the whole is wrote
with great judgement, perspicuity, and conciseness, as by one that was
altogether master of his subject.

We have reason to believe, he copied some memoirs wrote even in Roman
times.

He speaks of the warlike nation of the _Senones_, who lived in Surrey:
they, under the conduct of Brennus, passed into Gaul, and over the
Alpes, and besieged Rome. _Romam fastu elatam, ista incursione vastatam
solo: et Rempublicam Romanam funditus evertissent; ni eam Dii ipsi,
more Nutricis, in sinu quasi gestare videbantur_, &c.

Again, speaking of Bath, _Thermæ, Aquæ solis quibus fontibus præsules
erant Apollinis et Minervæ Numina_.

Our author mentions no less than thirty-eight Roman stations, beyond
the farthest _vallum_ of Antoninus; and in England innumerable cities,
towns, roads, &c. altogether new to us; such as _Forum Dianæ_, a city
of the _Cassii_: _Cantiopolis_: _Colonia gemina Martia_: _Theodosia_:
_Victoria_: _Isinnis_ and _Argolicum_, cities in _Lincolnshire_: _ad
Selinam_: _in medio_: _ad aquas_: _ad alone_: _statio Trajectus_: _ad
vigesimum sc. lapidem_: _Bibracte_, a city not far from London: _ad
lapidem_: _ad decimum_: and very many more.

He mentions _Via Julia_: a triumphal arch in _Camulodunum_: rivers,
promontories, woods, mountains, lakes, bays, ports, founders of cities,
things and matters not named before in any monuments come to our hands.

In _Cornwall_, he speaks of _Herculis columnæ_, and _insula Herculea_:
he remarks, the country of Cornwall, abounding with metals, was
formerly frequented by the Phœnicians and Greeks, who fetched tin from
thence; and that the local names there retain a Phœnician and Greek
turn.

_De Caledonia_, he describes this highland part of Britain very
particularly; their towns, mountains, promontories, &c. he speaks
of the report of Ulysses coming thither, tossed by tempests, and
sacrificing on the shore. This is mentioned in Orpheus’s _Argonautics_.

He speaks too of altars on the sea shore, beyond Inverness, set up by
the Romans, as marks and bounds of their dominion.

Till now, Edenburgh had the honour of being thought the _Pterooton_, or
_castra alata_ of the Romans; but our author removes it far away to the
river Varar in Scotland.

In _Caledonia_, though never conquered by the Romans, he gives us many
names of people and towns.

                   *       *       *       *       *

Cap. VII. _Itinerarium Brittaniarum omnium._ Our author had been
upbraided, particularly by an eminent prelate, for turning his head
this way, and spending his time in studies of this kind; which he here
apologizes for: he shows the use of these studies, and the certainty of
things he recounts.

“As to the certainty (says he) of the names of people and towns
transmitted to us, we can no more doubt of them, than of the being of
other ancient nations, such as the Assyrians, Parthians, Sarmatians,
Celtiberians, &c. of the names of Judea, Italy, Gaul, Brittain, London,
and the like, which remain to this day, the same as formerly, monuments
of the truth of old history.

“As to the use (says he) we learn hence the veracity of the holy
Scriptures; that all mankind sprung from one root, not out of the earth
as mushrooms: that a variety must be sought for in all studies.

“Particularly, this study gives us a noble instance of the efficacy of
the preaching of the Gospel; which with amazing celerity quite beat
down Paganism, through this country, he is describing, as well as
through the whole world.

“Another use of the study, is assisting us in forming true schemes of
chronology.”

Then, to the point, he acquaints us, he “drew much of his materials _ex
fragmentis quibusdam a Duce quodam Romano consignatis, et posteritati
relictis, sequens collectum est Itinerarium. additis ex Ptolemeo et
aliunde nonnullis_.”

He says, there were ninety-two eminent cities in Britain, thirty-three
more famous than the rest; nine colonies of the Roman soldiers; ten
cities of _Latio jure donatæ_, twelve _Stipendiariæ_.

All these he recites particularly.


                        DIAPHRAGMATA, or ITERS.

He gives us the whole length and breadth of the island in miles; and
then presents us with no less than nineteen _Iters_, or journeys,
in all manner of directions, quite across the island; the names of
places, and distances between; in the manner of that celebrated antique
monument, called Antoninus’s Itinerary.

Very many of the names of places here, are intirely new to us: and as
to the whole, though it is unavoidable, that they must in some journeys
coincide with Antoninus’s Itinerary, yet it is not in the least copied
from thence: nay, our author never saw that monument: on the contrary,
his _Iters_ are all distinct things; more correct and particular,
and much better conducted than the others, and likewise fuller: they
exceedingly assist us in correcting that work, on which the learned
have from time to time bestowed so much pains.

It is very obvious, that this must be of an extraordinary use and
certainty in fixing places, and their names, in our _Brittania Romana_:
which hitherto, for the most part, was done by guess-work, and
etymology, and criticism.

                   *       *       *       *       *

Cap. VIII. _De insulis Brittanicis._

He begins with Ireland; and besides a map of it along with that of
Britain, he gives an accurate description of the country, people,
rivers, promontories, divisions, manners, mensuration; the fertility of
the land, origin of the inhabitants, _&c._

A very exact chorography of the nations and cities:

Then of the other islands, Hebudes, Orcades, Thule, Wyght, and many
more.


                               LIBER II.

The chronological part of the work; which does not appear to have been
taken from other authors now known: it chiefly handles the chronology
of Britain, and its history, in matters not mentioned in other
chronologies.

All the imperial expeditions hither, those of legates, proprætors, in
their successive order; the taking of particular cities; the moving off
of British people into Ireland; the building of the walls; the Romans
abandoning _Vespasiana_ province; the persecutions of the christians.

The passage of the Scots from Ireland.

I need add no more, than, if Camden and Barton, Gale and Horsley, had
had Richard of Cirencester’s work, there had been nothing left for
others to do in this argument.

A very lively proof of the Romans conquering Scotland by Agricola in
Martial’s epigram,

    _Nuda Caledonio dum pectora præbuit Urso
      Non ficta pendens in cruce Laureolus._

Domitian was extravagantly fond of exhibitions in the amphitheatre:
Martial’s I. Lib. intirely taken up therewith; nothing more engaging
the emperor’s vanity, than for Agricola to send him some bears from
Scotland, for his shows.

                   *       *       *       *       *

Cap. II. An _elenchus_ of the Roman emperors and legates commanding in
Britain. The end is wanting.




                                  II.

                                ON THE
                        MAP of BRITTANIA ROMANA
                                  OF
                        RICHARD of CIRENCESTER.
                              A. D. 1338.
           Read at the +Antiquarian Society+, April 8, 1756.


At first sight, this map appears very extraordinary; but when I
came to compare it with those of Britain, in Ptolemy, and other old
geographers, I was much surprised to find how far it exceeds them:
_that_ in the oldest editions of Ptolemy is very mean, and especially
erroneous, in turning all the major part of Scotland toward the east,
instead of the north. Printed at Ulm, 1482.

I have Schottus’s edition at Argenson, 1513, with Mirandula’s
translation.

Also another edition, 1540, at Basil, by Munster: but the map of
Britain and Ireland, in all, poor and jejune.

The description in Ptolemy is composed from two separate pieces; one,
a map of all the country north of _Coria_, or of the _prætentura_ in
Scotland, which Agricola made: this, I say, when they came to join
it to the map of the rest of the island, they placed it eastward,
instead of northward; and from this erroneous map Ptolemy composed his
description of Britain. This map, in other respects, is very empty and
incorrect: our author himself finds fault with it.

Mercator afterwards made his map for the next edition of Ptolemy,
somewhat improved; but the northern part, or that of Scotland, still
aukwardly bent toward the east.

Consequent to this, Ortelius his map is much improved; the northern
part placed properly: yet in an unseemly manner, as well as out of the
rules of geography, he turns the western side of Britain and Ireland
upward in the plan, instead of the northern, agreeable to our present
geographical charts.

Next follows our Richard of Cirencester’s map, which exceeds them all,
beyond compare; and the more we consider it, the more we approve: it is
only equalled by his written description, or chorography of Britain;
but he turned his map with the east side uppermost, instead of the
north. We easily discern, how far it is preferred to the _Brittania
Romana_ of the excellent Mr. Camden, whose judgement and diligence we
have reason to admire.

There are in Brittain, says our author, cities of greater eminence
XCII. of greatest XXXIII. I give the modern names.

This is a most curious catalogue of matters hitherto we were ignorant
of; what British cities were _municipia_, what Roman colonies, what
free of Rome, what stipendiary. Colonies lived under the Roman laws;
_municipia_, under their own.

Ninnius and Gildas name twenty-eight most famous Roman cities in
Britain, which the excellent archbishop Usher has commented upon; but
the catalogue is quite different from ours: yet therein our author is
confirmed in calling Verulam a _municipium_. In Ninnius it is called
Caer, _municip_.

From ours we learn, in the early time of the empire, where the Roman
legions were quartered: the _legio gemina Martia victrix_ was the
XIVth, here said to be at _Camulodunum_, Colchester; it was left here
in Claudius’s time: this legion vanquished Boadicia; was called out of
Britain early by Vespasian. Here then we see our author’s manuscript
was prior to that time, viz. A. D. 70. I mean _that_ from whence he
extracted his work; the original manuscript: for we are to understand
of it, as we do of that called _Antonini Itinerarium_, that it was a
parchment roll made for the use of the emperor and his generals; which
being transmitted down from one general to another, and frequently
copied and transcribed, received from time to time several additions
and interpolations of cities new built; and likewise others struck out,
which were then in ruins.

The _legio Claudia_, quartered at Gloucester, was the VIIth _Aug._ This
legion came over into Britain with Julius Cæsar; he calls it _veterrima
legio_; it was named _Claudia_ from the emperor, and called _pia
fidelis_ by the Roman senate. Hence Gloucester was called _Claudio
cestria_, from its residence here: and that it resided here, we learn
from our author, who says he has it from writers of most ancient Roman
times. It remained here in Carausius’s time.

The _legio Cretica_, quartered at Westchester, was the XX. V. V. they
were in Britain in Nero’s time; settled here by Agricola, A. D. 84.
From our author only, we learn this title of _Cretica_, as having been
originally levied in _Crete_. This was here in Carausius’s time.

_Legio_ II. _Aug._ quartered at Caerleon in Wales, came into Britain in
the reign of Claudius, under the command of Vespasian. This legion was
stationed at Canterbury in some later times, according to our author,
C. VI. whence we gather, he compiled his work out of old writers of
different ages.

The _legio_ VI. came into Britain with Hadrian, settled at York; by
Mr. Gale thought to be called _Gordiana_. York was made a colony of
that legion. Antoninus Pius made it a _municipium_, and continued this
legion there: it was concerned in perfecting the Carsdike navigation to
Peterborough.

These legions are all mentioned in our author. Before the time that
Vespasian was emperor, Josephus relates, _Bell. jud._ II. 16. that king
Agrippa, in his speech to the Jews, in Nero’s time, and before that
emperor called the XIVth legion from Britain, speaks of four legions
then in Britain.

I have this further to add, in relation to our map: when I began to
consider it with that attention which it deserves, I was a little
surprised to see the river Trent, instead of falling northward into the
Humber, to be carried eastward through Lincolnshire, into the East sea.

I presently suspected, this was owing to the artificial cut of the
Romans, called Fossdike, part of the Carsdike; which Fossdike is drawn
from Torksey at the Trent, to Lincoln: there it meets the river Witham
coming from the south, and proceeds eastward toward Boston.

Ever since I was capable of observation, I often took notice, that the
whole flat, or fenny country of Lincolnshire, has a gentle declivity,
or natural descent eastward. This is owing not only to the sea lying
that way, but is the case of all levels in the whole globe: the cause
must be asserted to be the earth’s rotation upon its _axis_; which
observation I printed, long since, in my _Itinerarium Curiosum_.

It is a principle in nature, that, when a globe is turned on its
_axis_, the matter on the surface flies the contrary way to its motion.
The philosophers call this improperly a _conatus recedendi ab axe
motus_: it is not owing to an endeavour of matter to fly the contrary
way, but to the innate inactivity of matter that resists the motion;
does not readily follow it.

But it is evident from hence, that the earth, receiving its motion
before the surface was perfectly consolidated, the moistish matter
would be left westward, as far as it could be, and produce an extended
and gentle declivity on the east; and at the same time, by stiffening,
would render the west side of all hills steep.

This is a fact throughout the whole globe. Hence it is, that all plains
and levels have naturally their descent towards the east; and hence it
is, that the river of Witham, from Grantham side, running northward to
Lincoln, readily takes its course thence eastward, to meet the ocean
over the fenny level.

The Romans, when they made the artificial canal, the Carsdike, from
Peterborough along the edge of the Lincolnshire fens, introduced it
into the river Witham, three miles below Lincoln. The purpose of this
artificial cut was, to convey corn in boats, from the southern parts
of England, to the northern _prætentura_’s in Scotland for maintenance
of the forces kept there: therefore the canal, entering the Witham,
passed through Lincoln, and then was continued by another artificial
cut, called the Fossdike, from Lincoln to Torksey, where it enters the
Trent, in order to go down the stream to the Humber: from thence the
fleet of corn-boats passed up the river Ouse to York, by force of the
tide; for so high will the tide carry them; which was the reason of
building the city there.

After this Fossdike, between the Trent and Witham rivers, was made
by the Romans, it is easy to imagine, that the extensive river of
Trent, which runs altogether northwards, would very readily, upon
great floods, discharge part thereof into the Fossdike; for there
is a descent that way, as being to the east: and this might be the
occasion of the geography in our map, mistaking the Fossdike, and the
continuation of the Witham, for that of the Trent.

The river Witham, from Lincoln, goes south-east into the sea, by
Boston; and it seems to me, that in very early times it might (at least
in great floods) have another channel running over the East fen (as
called) along that natural declivity, full east, into the sea, as in
the map of Richard of Cirencester.

This channel might pass out of the present river of Witham a little
below Coningsby, where the river Bane falls into it, at Dockdike and
Youldale, by the water of Hobridge, north of Hundle-house; so running
below Middleholm to Blacksike, it took the present division between the
two wapentakes, all along the south sides of the deeps of the East fen;
and so by Blackgote to Wainfleet, the +Vainona+ of the Romans.

My friend, John Warburton, Esq; Somerset herald, has some manuscripts
of our Lincolnshire antiquary, some years ago, Mr. De la Pryme, who
was perfectly acquainted with that part of Lincolnshire, and therein
discovers some suspicions of the Trent running toward Lincoln in
antient days; but I think, all we can certainly conclude from our
map is the extreme antiquity of it: as the Carsdike must have been
projected and done by Agricola, on his conquest of Scotland, we may
reasonably judge this to be in the main his map, i.e. copied from his,
though with some additions by our author.

This consideration, duly attended to, shows the antiquity of the
Fossdike, and Carsdike, and of our map.

We are told in the History of Carausius, that he repaired the
_prætentura_ made in Scotland by Agricola, and added seven forts to it:
a wise and politic prince knew the necessity of it; and consequently
infer we, that he as surely repaired the Carsdike navigation, to supply
the soldiers with corn, in that northern situation: and I have several
reasons to induce me to conclude, he not only did so, but carried
it further southward than before, viz. from Peterborough quite to
Cambridge; some of which reasons I shall recite in the history of that
hero. At present I shall only hint, that his name has ever been affixed
to this famous canal, which has never been regarded by writers. It is
of utmost importance in the knowledge of Roman antiquity; and it is an
affair of such public emolument, as not to be unworthy of the notice of
the legislature; where an inland water-carriage is made, for 200 miles
in length, from Cambridge to Boroughbridge.

The Roman provinces, as we find them in our map, are these. _Maxima
Cæsariensis_, or _Brittania superior_, chiefly the country of the
Brigantes, conquered by Cerealis, and so named by him, in the beginning
of Vespasian’s reign.

_Valentia_, all that country comprehended between the two
_Prætentura_’s.

_Brittania prima_, or _inferior_, that part of the island south of the
Thames.

_Brittania secunda_, being Wales.

_Flavia Cæsariensis_, that part between the Humber and the Thames;
denominated from the family-name of Vespasian.

_Vespasiana_, that part of Scotland between the _Varar Æstuary_, or
highland boundary, and the northern _Prætentura_.

Lastly, _Caledonia_ properly, or the Highlands, which the Romans never
conquered; and that part called _Vespasiana_, after Agricola returned,
was neglected by Domitian, and recovered by the Scots; at least, to the
first _Prætentura_: and it is from Richard of Cirencester alone, that
we have an Itinerary of it from the _Vararis Æstuary_, on which is the
last Roman station, called _Alata castra_, now Inverness.

I shall next recite all the places, rivers, mountains, &c. specified in
our map, the provinces they are in, and _that_ in alphabetical order;
together with the modern names of each, according to the best of my
knowledge; whereby the value and excellence of our manuscript will more
easily appear; seeing so many of them we were hitherto unacquainted
withall, which I shall mark particularly thus *, as also those wherein
we are able to correct former writers.

Thus I have recounted the names of places contained in this excellent
map, to the number of 250; whereof 100, marked in this catalogue thus
*, are wholly new, or ill-placed by former writers. The reader versed
in these kind of inquiries, will find no small number of them; to
his judgement I leave them: as to me, the finding fault with others
endeavours is very disagreeable. This I may say; it sets us right
in abundance, wherein before we had no guide but conjecture, from
similitude of names: as, for instance, _Uxella_, placed in some great
authors at _Lestwthiel_, _Cornwall_, is in _Somersetshire_, viz. at
_Barton_, where the Roman road called Foss crosses the river, a little
north of Ilchester. Many more might be specified, where only a map can
properly direct us.

I must take notice of another use in our map. In the province of
_Brittania Prima_ are two _Venta_’s; but till now we could not
ascertain them both: the map shows us, one is _Wimborn minster_, the
other _Winchester_: the former is on the river _Alauna_, seen plainly
in _Blandford_, being the ford over the _Alauna_; _Llaunford_, in
the Belgic pronunciation: called now _Allen_ river. Our author calls
_Canterbury_, _Cantiopolis_, though before we knew no other name it had
than _Durovernum_: but the modern name of _Canterbury_ seems derived
from the former; and the termination favours our author’s observation,
in another part of his history, of remains of Greek traders preserved
in some places; of which several more instances may be given.

I extend my inquiries here, on Richard of Cirencester’s map, no further
than our island of Britain; leaving that of Ireland to those that have
proper opportunities.

Nor shall I pretend to assign places in Scotland, any further than
the map directs me; but leave them too to those that have proper
opportunities of inquiry, in that kingdom.




                                 III.


Let us now proceed to his Itinerary; a truly invaluable monument! From
these two we may hope to obtain a complete knowledge of Roman Britain.


                              CAPUT VII.

Our author calls these, _Iters_ of his _Diaphragmata_, from their
similitude to the animal midriff, passing through the body from side to
side.

_Rhutupis colonia_, Sandwich, Richborough and Stonar castle, Kent, is
the first city, says our author, in the island of Britain, towards
Gaul; situate among the _Cantii_, opposite to _Gessoriagum_, the port
of _Bononia_, Boloign. Hence is the most commodious passage of +CCCCL.+
_stadia_, or, as others will have it, +XLVI.+ miles.

From that city _Rhutupium_, says he, is drawn the Roman way called
Guithlin-street, quite to _Segontium_, Caernarvon, through the space of
+CCCXXIV.+ miles, or thereabouts. Thus,

To _Cantiopolis_, which is also called _Durobernum_, _stipendiaria_,
Canterbury, Kent, +X.+ miles.

_Durosevum_ +XII.+ Sittingburn, Kent.

                                 XXV.

_Duroprovis_, _stipendiaria_, Rochester, Kent.

Thence, at +XXVII.+ miles, it passes the Thames, and enters the
province _Flavia_, and the city of _Londinium Augusta_, London. Thence

                                  IX.

To _Sulloniagis_, _Suellaniacis_, Edgeware, Middlesex.

                                 XII.

_Verolamium_, _municipium_, Verlamcester, or St. Alban’s. Of this place
were Amphibalus and Albanus, martyrs.

                                 XII.

_Forum Dianæ_, Market street, near Dunstable, Hertfordshire.

                                 XII.

_Magiovinium_, Dunstable, Bedfordshire.

                                 XII.

_Lactorodum_, Stoney Stratford, Bucks.

                                 XII.

Were I to recite all I have written upon this work, by way of comment,
it would amount to a large volume; yet some few remarks I must make.

                   *       *       *       *       *

What all others call _Durolenum_ our author names _Durosevum_, which I
affix to Sittingburn, favouring this reading: the distance conformable.

_Sulloniacis_, or rather _Suellaniacis_, has its name from _Suellan_,
or _Cassibelin_, who fought Cæsar. I place it at Edgware, which has
its name from the _agger_, or high raised Roman way, Watling-street.
Here was Cassibelin’s usual residence: his _oppidum_, or military town,
which Cæsar stormed, was at Watford.

_Forum Dianæ_, a new name, was crouded into the roll of the original
Itinerary, where the intermediate distance, +XII.+ miles, between St.
Alban’s and Dunstable, remained unaltered: therefore the transcriber
repeated the same distance erroneously.

I doubt not, the place is what we now call Market-street, a little on
this side Dunstable, upon the great road Watling-street. Here was a
fane, and _forum_, or portico, sacred to Diana; where a panegyre, or
fair, as we call it, was annually celebrated, to the honour of the
goddess, by the lovers of hunting, on the great festival sacred to her,
when stags were sacrificed: this was upon August 13, the hunters’ day,
in the Roman kalendar.

I have no need to be ashamed in acknowledging an error incurred in my
juvenile travels, when we knew nothing of this work of our author’s;
for now I apprehend _Durocobrivis_ is another name of a town near this
place: the modern name of _Redburn_ proves it, which means the same as
_Durocobrivis_, the passage over the _Redwater_ brook.

_Rotten row_, _Rowend_, _Flamsted_ by _Forum Dianæ_, names importing
high antiquity: _Rotten row_, just by _Bremenium_, Ruchester; again at
Dorchester, Oxfordshire: they relate to panegyres, or fairs.

_Manduessedum_, Mancester, on each side the Watling-street, was walled
about.

The _vestigia_ of _Benonis_ are at Claybrook.

Thus we have the whole length of the Watling-street, from Dover to
Caernarvon.

Caernarvon stands on the river Seint, _Seient_, _Segont_, said to have
been built by Constantine the Great. Nennius gives it the name _Kaer
Kustenidh_, for that reason: he probably made the _Via Heleniana_, in
honour of his mother, called _Sarn Helen_.

_Herirus mons_ has its name from the eagles inhabiting the place,
Celtic.

Iter VI. of Antoninus, a _Londinio Lindum_, goes quite a different way
from this; the one to the right, the other to the left of the straitest
way, the Hermen-street. Instead of our _Durnomagus_ on the northern, he
mentions _Durobrivis_, Chesterton, on the southern bank of the river
Nen, a walled city: a bridge over the river, built since the time of
our Itinerary. And also

From _Camboritum_ to _Durosiponte_, in this _Iter_ of ours, and Vth of
Antoninus, I collect, the Roman city of Cambridge, _Granta_, was not
then in being.

I suppose, it was founded by Carausius, when he carried the Carsdike
from Peterborough to Cambridge, and made the road over Gogmagog
hill from _Durosiponte_, Godmanchester, to _Camulodunum colonia_,
Colchester; for all these Itineraries were made before Carausius’s time.

Thus we have finished this famous Itinerary, much more large than that
of Antoninus, contains many names of places not comprised therein, and
ascertains much more of the geography of Roman Britain, of England, and
Scotland: it is useful to recite an alphabetical index of it, marking
those places with an asterisc, not mentioned by former writers, or not
rightly assigned to the modern names and places; and still leaving many
to the diligence and _acumen_ of future writers.

Here are recounted 173 places in Britain, being 62 more than are
contained in Antoninus’s Itinerary: and of those in our Itinerary I
have marked with an asterisc no less than 76, which are either intirely
new, or not rightly assigned to their true situations in former writers.




                                  IV.

                    OBSERVATIONS on the ITINERARY.


In my former papers I discoursed to the Society, first, in rehearsal of
the memoirs we can recover concerning Richard of Cirencester, and of
his writings.

I gave an account of the most excellent Map of Roman Britain, prefixed
to the Treatise we are upon. This not only enables us to fix many
places and stations, which before now we could do only by mere
conjecture, and etymology of names, and the like; but further, it gives
us 100 places not hitherto known, so much as in name.

Come we now to treat on the Itinerary, comprised in 18 _Iters_, which
traverse the island of Britain all manner of ways, in the nature of
that we call Antoninus’s Itinerary; with the intermediate miles between
every station: to which I have assigned the respective modern names of
the places, to the best of my knowledge.

This Itinerary of our author is far more copious than that of
Antoninus: especially it takes in the whole kingdom of Scotland,
that country reduced by the valiant Agricola, and called by him
_Vespasiana_, when made a province, in honour to the reigning
emperor’s father: it took him up seven whole years to complete this
great conquest: and one of our _Iters_ extends from _Alata castra_,
Inverness, to the Land’s End in Cornwall.

From due consideration we have reason to believe, this Itinerary of our
author’s, as to the original plan, is no other than that of Agricola.
After he was recalled by Domitian, about A. D. 85. to Hadrian’s time,
Britain was neglected, Agricola’s cities in Scotland overthrown, his
castles dismantled; so that Tacitus well says, _Perdomita Britannia et
statim amissa_: he means only Scotland subdued by Agricola; for four
legions remained in that part we call England, to keep it in subjection
till Hadrian came.

To our itinerary alone, and the Map, are we indebted for the knowledge
of the stations in Scotland: so that we must conclude, he had sight of
manuscripts and rolls which were written in that time; whether in the
libraries at Rome, or in the monastic libraries of Britain, we know
not: but from the same libraries Antoninus’s Itinerary, and the like
monuments of learned antiquity, were taken.

It would seem that Whittichind, the Saxon author, had seen such like
works as our Richard perused; he writes, that Britain was divided into
provinces by Vespasian.

Richard writes expresly, that he copied some papers transmitted to
posterity by a Roman general, who probably was Agricola; he had some
informations from certain religious of his order, who had been in
Scotland.

He learnt what he writes on _Caledonia_, from British merchants. Again,
speaking of _Glevum_, Gloucester, he says, it is a Roman colony,
constituted by Claudius, _ut scriptores de istis temporibus affirmant_;
so that he omitted no kind of means to acquire knowledge of the British
geography.

_In medio_, _ad fines_, _ad Itunam flu. ad montem Grampium_, _Herirus
mons_, _Alpes Pennini_, _ad Pontem_, _ad Murum_, _ad Vallum_; a very
great number of these, and the like, being recited, intimate the high
antiquity of the Itinerary; that the roads were generally made, or
marked out; but towns, cities, castles, not then built, only some inns,
for present conveniency. Especially we see this in Scotland, a good
way on the sea-coast northerly, and remarkably in the IXth Iter; _ad
Tavum_, _ad Æsicam_, _ad Tinam_, _ad Itunam_, _ad montem Grampium_,
_ad Selinam_; and in the map these rivers are named, and the Grampian
mountain, without a town’s name annexed, as then not fully built; and
probably that country was left by the Romans before the towns were
built, the Romans having chiefly strong camps by the rivers. We may
reasonably hence judge, the original itinerary and map, which our
Richard copied, was constructed in Agricola’s time; though afterward
additions were made to it.

We see likewise this method of nomination used in other more distant
parts, as _Herirus mons_ in Wales, _Alpes pennini_ in the mountainous
tract of Lancashire.

In Iter IV. _Ad Tisam amnem_, _Ad Murum_, _Ad Alaunam flu._ _Ad Tuedam
flu._ _Ad Vallum_.

In Iter XI. _Ad Alone_, _Ad Sabrinam_, _Tibia amnis_, _Ad Vigesimum
lapidem_, &c.

In Iter XV. _Ad Lapidem_, _Ad Decimum lapidem_, where only mile-stones
are named; and the remains of this manner of denomination are left
in the English names _Stoneham_, _Stone_, _Stanefield_, _Stanwic_,
_Stanton_, and the like.

We learn to correct many words in our geography, which before were
not truly wrote: for instance, _Bannavenna_, Towcester, sometimes
_Benavona_, _Bennaventa_, which words have no meaning, is really
_Isannavaria_, ill placed at Weedon, or rather _Isantavaria_; which
words are easily deduced from the British.

                   *       *       *       *       *

I judge it will be a matter useful to the Studious in this kind of
learning, to collect into one general Index all the names of places,
hitherto recited in the Map and Itinerary, with the annexed asterisc,
denoting those names, which are new, or better placed than in former
books, or of new denomination; to which we must add those recited in
his VIth chapter of the Chorography of Britain. This contains above 100
names not found in my friend Mr. Baxter’s _Glossarium Brittanicum_;
who has collected all the names we before knew; and this present must
justly be esteemed the noblest monument of antient Britain.

This is a collective index, much the largest extant, of all the places
mentioned in the Map, in the Itinerary, in the Chorography, of Richard
of Cirencester’s work. It contains in the whole 500 names of antiquity,
whereof about 150 I have signed with an asterisc, as wholly new, more
correctly named, or placed, than in former writers on the subject.
We must needs look on it as a great treasure in Roman antiquities. I
have assigned the modern names. It is impossible I should be exact in
all, either in England, or Wales, or Scotland: they must be left to
the studious, who have proper skill and opportunities to examine them,
and make a just use of the great light here thrown on the face of our
island, in the earliest times of the Romans: some I have purposely
omitted, that the lovers of these antiquities may use like diligence
to fill up those vacancies, as well as correct others, which future
discoveries will enable them to do.

The following is a specimen of the writing of the original manuscript,
and explication thereof.

                            NOTÆ IN CAP. I.

I _Finis erat orbis_, &c.[3] +Homerus+[4] primus, saltem Græcos inter,
(de iis enim, quæ +Orpheo+ tribuuntur, adhuc sub judice lis est,)
terram undiquaque Oceano cinctam allui[5] pronunciavit, opinio forte
ipsi terræ coæva, quod verba, quæ sequuntur +Clementis+ Alexandrini
innuere videntur; en ipsa verba: Mensam autem in Templo, (altare
quoque thymmiamatis a +Moyse+ jussu divino factum)[6], habere undulas
inflexas ac tortiles, (communiter coronam appellant,) significat
terram, quam oceanus circumfluit[7]. Recepta hæc erat Philosophorum[8],
Geographorum[9], Historicorum[10], & Poetarum[11], tum gentilium[12],
tum Christianorum[13] opinio, atque quod ad Europam, Asiam & Africam,
veterum orbem attinet, consentit illa ad unguem cum recentissimis &
optimis observationibus. Hoc est cur veteres extrema littora finem
terræ & naturæ dixerint[14]. Patet hoc, ut alios omittam, ex his
+Virgilii+ Romanorum Coryphæi dictis:

    _Extremique hominum_ Morini——[15]

populi in Galliæ finibus, qui Britanniam spectant, proximi
oceano[16], & ultra oceanum quid erat præter Britanniam[17], oceani
insulam[18] ultimam occidentis[19], quam fallax æstu circuit ipse
oceanus[20], cujus licet magnitudinem olim nemo, ut +Livius+ refert,
circumvectus[21], +Panegyricus+[22] tamen Maximiano & Constantino Impp.
dictus aperte docet, eam tantæ magnitudinis a Cæsare habitam, ut non
circumfusa oceano, sed complexa ipsum oceanum videretur[23]. Hæc cum
verbis +Ricardi+[24] consentiunt, quæ verba sunt apud +Solinum+[25]
eadem. Britannia judicata est orbis finis juxta +Valerium Catullum+
qui Albionem nostram ultimam Britanniam[26], ejusque incolas Britannos
ultimos appellat[27]. Sequitur eum in hoc +Horatius Flaccus+ ita pro
salute Augusti vota nuncupans:

    _Serves iturum Cæsarem in ultimos
    Orbis Britannos————_[28]

nisi cum Beato +Chrysostomo+ tibi placuerit Britanniam extra orbem
positam[29], Romanorumque virtutem in orbem redactam dicere[30]. In
Romanorum nomen elementa transierunt[31], in quos etiam transivit orbis
terrarum, qui Romano Imperio clauditur & definitur. unde a plerisque
Orbis Romanus appellatur[32]; ita +M. Annæus Lucanus+

    _————quin respicis orbem
    Romanum?_[33]

Et denuo de Cæsare sermonem faciens idem Poëta canit:

    _Hic cui Romani spatium non sufficit orbis._[34]

Sed vero propius ad ipsam rem accidit +Claudius Claudianus+ ita
loquendo:

    _——nostro deducta Britannia mundo._[35]

_Nomen pene orbis alterius_, &c.[36]]. Alii veterum auctorum non
parce adeo loquuntur, liquet hoc ex his apud optimos eorum obviis
expressionibus:

    _At nunc oceanus geminos interluit orbes._[37]

Britannia oceani insula interfuso mari toto orbe divisa[38], ALTER
ORBIS appellatur[39], postquam Romanorum subjecta esset imperio, ita
canentes audimus:

    _Conjunctum est, quod adhuc Orbis, & Orbis erat_[40].
    _Et jam Romano cingitur Oceano_[41].

Et quamvis toto orbe divisa, tamen, qui vinceret, habuit Britannia[42],
quæ præ magnitudine videri possit alia terra continens[43]. omnibus
terra marique, a Cæsare, captis, respexit oceanum, & quasi hic Romanus
orbis non sufficeret, alterum (Britannicum) cogitavit[44]; aut cum
+Claudiano+ vate:

    _Vincendos alio quæsiverit in orbe Britannos_[45].

Hic orbis terra est, quam ultra oceanum sitam fingit +Cosmas+
Indicopleustes[46], opinio inveterata. Plautius Legatus enim, ut testis
est +Dio Cassius+[47], difficulter exercitum e Gallia abduxit, indigne
ferentem, quod extra orbem terrarum bellum esset gerendum, scilicet in
Britannia

    _————quæ procul orbe jacet_[48].

Nam si verum quæramus, terra ipsa infra Romanorum Imperium est,
super quam progressa Romana virtus ultra Oceanum, alterum sibi orbem
quæsivit, & in Britannia remota a confinio terrarum novam sibi invenit
possessionis[49], aut ut iste +Panegyricus+[50] eleganter mentem suam
explicat, Cæsar alium se orbem terrarum scripsit reperisse[51], &
in Britanniam transjecisse exercitum, alterum pene imperio nostro,
ac suo quærens orbem[52], non oblitur alibi ita Constantinum Magnum
alloqui: gloriare tu vero, Cæsar invicte! alium te orbem terrarum
peperisse[53]. Demum +Nennius+ noster narrat, in extremo limite orbis
Britanniæ esse Orcaniam insulam[54]. Unde hæ orbis particulæ, Orbis
vocabulum traxerunt, ex +Aristotele+ discere poterit Lector, ad quem
eum, prolixitatis evitandæ gratiæ, remitto[55].

_Insula_, &c.] Primis Græcorum Romanorumque ne esse quidem compertum
fuit: posteriores in controversiam adduxerunt, continensne ea terra,
an vero insula esset, multaque de utroque opinione conscripta sunt ab
iis, qui certi quidem nihil noverunt, quippe qui nec vidissent, nec ab
indigenis, qualis esset, accepissent, sed conjecturis tantum, quantum
vel otii vel studii singulis aderat, niterentur. Successu temporis,
prius quidem sub J. Agricola Proprætore[56], deinde sub Severo
Imperatore, liquido deprehensum esse insulam[57].

_Octingentis M. P. longa porrigitur._] Hæc longitudo Britanniæ a
+M. Vipsanio Agrippa+ tributa, cujus mentionem injicit +C. Plinius
Secundus+[58], sequentibus ipsum +Julio Solino+[59], +Martiano

venerabili +Beda+[64], +Nennio+ Banchorensi[65], & pluribus aliis,
quæ supra 730 milliaria Anglicana Statutaria, vel Regia, efficit.
Hæc longitudo quamvis reperiatur nimia, ad veritatem tamen proximius
accedit, illa, quam +Jornandes+ Episcopus (ex Cassio Dione[66]
exhibet, longitudine, qui eam VII. M. CXXXII. Stadia extendi ferri
narrat[67], i. e. DCCCXCI. milliarium Romanorum cum dimidio, aut
minoris aliquantum fuisse extensionis, quam 820 nostrorum milliarium.
quippe inde ab Ocrino (_Lizard Point_) extremo meridionali promontorio,
usque ad Orcadem extremum, _Dungsby_ (vel potius _Dunnet_[68]) _head_,
maxime versus Boream vergentem sint 590 milliaria Regia, secundum
recentissimas & fide dignissimas relationes, quæ non prorsus DCL
Milliaria Romana efficiunt. Mappæ geographicæ seculi prioris[69]
longitudinem ad 50, aliæ 75, & aliæ 120 plus minus milliaria, majorem
extendunt, id est ad DCC Millia passuum.

_In Caledonicum promuntorium_, &c.] Extremitas Caledoniæ +Ricardi+
nostri[70] potius intelligenda est, de toto angulo[71] boreali Scotiæ.
scilicet, Rossia, Sutherlandia, Cathenesia, Strath-navernia cum vicinis
regiunculis, quæ eis subsunt, quam de singulari quodam promontorio.
Monachus noster semper in syllaba secunda ad morem plurium Monachorum
adhibet U, qui scribendi mos, ceu maxime genuinus assumitur, a +Is.
Vossio+[72] ac +Gronoviis+ in iis, quas nobis dedere, Pomponii Melæ
editionibus, certe optimis, in quibus semper promuntorium cum U in
secunda syllaba reperies; quas, si lubuerit, consulas[73].

II. _Veteres Britanniam_, &c.[74]] Quodnam antiquissimum & genuinum
Magnæ Britanniæ inter tot varias appellationes, quibus ab extraneis
propriisque incolis insignita fuit, nomen fuerit, inventu est
perquam difficile, præsertim nostro, quo adeo longe distamus,
tempore; etenim, ut docent verba auctoris, & nos etiam deinceps[75]
evidenter explicabimus, omnes insulæ in vicinia sitæ commune nomen
+Britannicarum+ habuere. Ut plurimæ aliæ regiones sic & hæc nomen
suum a primo ejus conditore hausit, verum autem quis hic fuerit,
æque ignotum, ac nomen, de quo quæritur. Tantum ex paucis, qui
nobis supersunt, Scriptoribus novimus, quod fuerit appellata his
nominibus: BRITANNIA, ALBION[76], +Hyperborea+[77], +Atlantia+[78],
+Cassiteris+[79], ROMANIA[80], nec non +Thule+[81], quæ nomina a
Phœnicibus Græcis & Romanis ipsi data fuere, sed quodnam aut an ullum
illorum sit genuinum incertum adeo est, ut verear ne nunquam satis
demonstrari possit. ALBION & BRITANNIA jus antiquitatis sibi vindicant,
cum apud Poëtas Britannos, seu +Bardos+ ejusdem sub nominibus +Alban+,
vel +Alben+, +Inis Wen+[82], sive +Insulæ Albæ+[83] & +Prydæn+[84]
fiat mentio. ALBION antiquissimum censetur, quamtumvis nullum horum
nominum sit illud, in quod inquirimus, cum Romanis bene nota fuerint.
e contrario vero, si in re tanti momenti testimonio +Dionis Cassii+
sides habenda est, Britannorum Regina BONDUICA affirmet, Romanorum
sapientissimos verum nomen (indigenarum) ignorasse[85]. Hinc forte
investigandum erit nomen, aliud a supradictis. interea de singulis hic
allegatis nobis erit sermo.

_Primum Albionem_, &c.[86]]. Ni ita dicta fuerit ab +Albione+ Conditore
vel Debellatore ejus, quem quidem Albionem Neptuni filium fuisse
asserunt[87], certe ratio sit gravis hanc appellationem rejiciendi
adesse videtur, cum certum sit ac evictum, totam insularum classem,
tempore Aristotelis[88], & verosimiliter jam diu ante ipsum,
Britannicarum nomen gessisse. Præterea, si etiam ab albis rupibus a
Phœnicibus sic fuerit nuncupata, nil tamen ex eo sequitur, quam quod
fuerit nomen impositum, neutiquam genuinum, nisi affirmemus, cum
quibusdam aliis[89], Phœnices fuisse primos hanc regionem incolentes,
quod, antequam sufficienter fuerit demonstratum, pro evicto assumere
nullus potero. Attamen admissa hac opinione, detectis metallifodinis
stanno ברת־אנך‏‎[90] _Barat-anac_, id est _agrum_ seu _terram stanni_
& plumbi, eos sine dubio dixisse, idque nomen omnibus circumjacentibus
insulis dedisse, cum omnes fere ejusdem naturæ & conditionis sint,
tanta gaudet verisimilitudine, ut ulteriori indagine originis nominis
+Cassiteridis+, minime opus videatur. Notum enim est, Græcos ei id
nominis dedisse[91], cum eundem, quem præcedens habeat significatum
& Κασσίτερον indigitet _stannum_, uti hoc probabit +Plinius+[92]
& prolixius +Bochartus+[93]. Phœnices autem, me judice, non fuere
primi incolæ, verum tantum mercatores, primi in has partes mercatum
proficiscentes, suaque ibi erigentes emporia, (_Factories_) quemadmodum
hodie Europæi in oris maritimis Africæ simile faciunt, sequitur
hinc, nomen quodcunque, ejusque generis nomina ab extraneis regioni
imposita, longe abesse a genuino a nativis incolis indito, ex istorum
lingua nullo modo derivando. Quod in totum destruit speciosas a
+Cambdene+[94], +Baxtero+[95], & +Somnero+[96] factas derivationes,
licet hucusque receptas maximo cum applausu. Verum errari in his
omnibus, dies absque dubio, cum nomen e lingua incolarum vernacula
originem trahat, sitque purum putum Britannicum; posito autem me eo
acquiescere, non tamen inde sequitur, hæc nomina Britannica a nativis
gentibus imposita esse, peregrini potius advenientes, ad quæstiones
incolis, aut Gallis datas, responsa accipientes inde ita appellandi
occasionem sumsere, cum eorum linguam Phœnices calluisse nullus
credendi locus, hincque signis mentem suam explicaverint necesse est.
Sic manu significantibus Britanniam, nomenque sciscitantibus, alii eos
_altas rupes_ cretaceas intellectas credentes, respondere: +Alben+,
vel +Brytin+, atque ea ratione e vocabulis _Al_, _Alp_, _Ben_, _Pen_,
_Bryd_, _Pryd_, _Bryt_, _Tin_, vel _Dyn_, diversos significatus
admittentibus[97], plurimæ aliæ pro diversitate ingeniorum quibus
responsa dabantur, oriri potuerunt rerum & regionum appellationes,
quæ pro nominibus insulæ habitæ, auctoritate donatæ ad nostra servatæ
sunt tempora. non absimili modo Peru, Jucatan, Paria, tres regiones
Americæ eminentiores nomina accepere, quod doctissimus +Raleius+
affirmat & asseverat[98], etenim Hispani digitis trans fluvium
sitas terras innuentibus, & primæ regionis nomen quærentibus, Indi
regessere: _Peru_, quod forte nomen hujus amnis erat, aut _aquam_ in
genere denotabat in lingua his vernacula. Jucatan nec aliud quicquam
significat, quam, _Quid ais? quid tibi vis?_ ita enim Hispanis,
rogantibus nomen loci, Barbaros (cum non intelligerant) respondisse
ferunt, idque responsum Hispanos in nomen loci transtulisse. Tertiam
quod attinet regionem, eodem ista modo nomen est sortita. cum Hispani
de nomine regionis quærerent, manu montes excelsos monstrantes,
quidam incolarum _Paria_ respondit, quo vocabulo _Rupes_, _Montesque_
innuuntur, ut alia ejusdem farinæ exempla præteream, quorum mentionem
præclarus hic auctor injicit[99], & quæ omnia ad nostrum scopum æque
inservire possent. Corrupta insuper genuini nominis pronuntiatio, illud
ita alterare potest, ut etymologiam omnino nullam admittat. Exempla
nobis sint, ea quæ nosmet ipsi civitatibus: Corunnæ, Setubal, & Portui
Liburno, tribuimus nomina, barbare eas vocantes: _the Groin_, _Saint
Ubes_, _Leghorn_. Quot quæso! in linguis peregrinis voces audimus,
quas ne imitari quidem, nedum accurate scribere possumus? Omiserunt
ista veteres aut mutarunt nomina. Patet hoc ex hisce a +Mela+ dictis:
“Cantabrorum aliquot populi amnesque sunt, sed quorum nomina nostro
ore concipi nequeunt.”[100]. Nomina Britanniæ igitur a peregrinis
ortum trahunt, unde genuinum nomen gentis a Regina Bonduica indicatum,
inter deperdita facile numerari posset. Sic ab Oceano Atlantico, vel
Hyperboreo, in quo sita est Britannia[101], ATLANTIA, & HYPERBOREA
vocata; THULE, cum sit inter insulas notas ultima[102]; nomen vero
ROMANÆ, Romanum plane est. Denique error est apud +Spedium+[103],
+Somnerum+[104], aliosque quod assertum, quod _vocabulo gentis suæ_
ita vocari dicunt regionem, implicet Britannicum esse nomen, nil
aliud indigitat, quam insulam sic a nomine incolarum vocatam, quod ex
citationibus ex classicis auctoribus desumtis sat superque demonstrari
potest[105]. Hac ratione incidimus in eam ab initio quæ subiit mentem,
cogitationem, scilicet, an insula _Britannia_ aut _Albion_ ab incolis
fuerit dicta? si unquam insula, Britannia, aut Albion ab indigenis
dicta est, primo ejus Conditori, vel Subjugatori nomen debet, & in his
acquiesco. Reliquæ inde, a capite omnium, appellationes suas habebunt.

Post ipsum +Plinius+[123] insulas Britannicas sequenti ordine enumerat:
+Britannia+ & +Hibernia+, XL Orcades, VII Acmodæ, XXX Hebudes,
item Mona, Monapia, Ricina, Vectis, quam errans versus occidentem
sitam affirmet, [quamvis sint, qui eam insulam ab hac distinctam
faciunt, eam scilicet quam Ptolemæus Ocetin vocat.] Limnus, Andros,
Siambis, Axantos, deinde Glessariæ, quas Electrides Græci recentiores
appellavere, nec non & Thule, Mictis, Scandia, Dumna, Bergos & Nerigon.
+Johannes Chrysostomus+ in diversis locis de insulis in plurali numero
loquitur, nominans eas Βρεττανικας νήσους[124].

    _Brettanides insulæ jacent circa Thraciam,
    Duæ maximæ omnium: prima Ibernia,
    Et Albion post ipsam. Ipsæ aliarum primæ.
    Et aliæ triginta vocatæ Orcades:

    In Aparctiæ flatum proxima vocata.
    Ex his triginta sunt Hesperides.
    Ad partes enim vespertinas sitæ sunt Brettaniæ_[125].

Verum cum duæ ipsarum multo majores sint ulla ex ceteris, hoc ipsum
+Aristoteli+[126], +Dionysio+[127], +Agathemero+[128], +Apuleio+[129],
&c. ansam præbuit, tantum harum duarum injiciendi mentionem.

    _Duæ insulæ sunt Britannicæ, contra Rhenum:
    Illic enim extremum eructat in mare vorticem.
    Harum sane magnitudo immensa: neque ulla alia
    Insulas inter omnes Britannicis æquatur_ [æqualis est.]

(_the Northwest_), respectu Romæ, quod bene a +Johanne Tzetza+ hoc
versu expressum

    _Thracias perflat Brettanorum atque Ethruscam regionem
    Romanosque————_[131]

Thracias vero inter Aparctiam & Argesten spirat, quem accolæ etiam
Circium appellant secundum +Agathemerum+[132], & +A. Gellium+[133].

_Maxumis Europæ partibus_, &c.] Versus orientem Norwagia, Dania &
Germania, ad meridiem vero Gallia & Hispania.

_Magno intervallo_, &c.] Melius hoc intuitu Mappæ geographicæ faciem
Europæ exhibentis patebit, quam verbis describi poterit.

_Oceano Athlantico clauditur._] Universam ipsam terram insulam esse

Porro autem Pelagus, quod extra orbem nobis habitatum fusum est, &
Atlanticum dicitur, & Oceanus a quo ipse circumluitur.

    Hesperius statim enim Oceanus vocatur,
    Et Pelagus Atlanticum, pars quædam ad occasum.
    Ad boream autem Saturnium & congelatum, mortuumque_[135].

Certum est Magnam Britanniam diversis temporibus mox nomen ab hoc
Oceano accepisse, mox illi idem reddidisse. minimum hoc de parte
Oceani Septentrionali & Occidentali, etiam ea quæ ultra Fretum
Gaditanum est, valet, etenim Britanniam veterum esse Atlantiam, si
unquam exstetit, pro concesso assumo. Sic habet +Adamus+ Bremensis
de mari Septentrionali; (_the North Sea_) sermonem faciens[136]:
‘Egdora descendit usque in Oceanum Fresonicum, quem Romani scribunt
Britannicum. inde (_the Channel_, Gallicè, _la Manche_) ad promontorium
Antivestæum +Ptolemæus+, aliique Oceanum Britannicum vocant. Porro
+Pomponius Mela+, natione Hispanus, Pyrenæum montem in Oceanum
Britannicum procurrere dicit[137]. Et Geographus +Ravennas+, fretum
Septem-Gaditanum in Oceanum Britannicum ingredi refert[138]. Quibus
addimus +Ricardum+ nostrum, qui infra, Oceanum Occidentalem, Magnum

IV. _à Meridie Galliam Belgicam._] Potius ab Euro.

_Cujus proximum littus_, &c.] Infra descriptam cap. VI. §. 5. & cap.
VII. pag. 96.

_à Gessoriaco Morinorum Brittanicæ gentis portu_, &c.] Bononia, hodie
_Boulogne_. vide infra pagina 96. Locus hic auctoris nostri non prius
plene intelligi potest, donec capitis XVIImi libri IVti +Plinii+ vera
lectio fuerit restituta, quam hanc esse arbitror:

  _Loco communiter usitatæ lectionis._

  ‘Deinde Menapii, Morini, Oromansaci juncti pago, qui Gessoriacus
  vocatur: Britanni, Ambiani, Bellovaci, Hassi.’

  _Ita legendum esse autumo._

  Deinde Menapii, Morini, Pæmani[140], ac juncti pago, qui
  Gessoriacus vocatur, Britanni: Ambiani, Bellovaci, Essui[141].

Etenim propter defectum recti sensus loci hujus Pliniani, +Harduinus+
Hassos omittit, ac +Dionysius Vossius+ Essuos in Æduos mutat[142], cum
e contrario, juxta meam emendationem, non omnia solum sint perspicua,
verum & sine ulteriori meditatione ultimum caput libri IVti Plinii
intellectu perquam facile reddatur, ubi verba ita sonant: ‘+Polybius+
latitudinem Europæ ab Italia ad Oceanum scripsit X̅I̅. L. (1150.) M. P.
etiam tum incomperta magnitudine ejus, est autem ipsius Italiæ X̅I̅. XX.
(1120.) M. ad Alpes, unde per Lugdunum ad portum Morinorum Brittanicum,
qua videtur mensuram agere Polybius X̅I̅I̅I̅. XVIII. (1318). M.P.’ &c.
quæ hucusque a nimine recte intellecta fuere. Quomodo, & quo tempore
hi +Britanni+ in Galliam venerunt, superest, ut inquiramus. Cæsar qui
data occasione omnes Gallorum nationes enumerat, de Britannis tacet,
neque de portu ipsorum Gessoriaco loquitur, unde jure concludimus, eos
Cæsaris tempore ibi non fuisse. +Dionysius+ Characenus videtur primus,
qui eos hoc versu nominat[143]:

    _————ubi Britanni,
    Albæque gentes habitant martiorum Germanorum,
    Hercyniæ sylvæ prætersalientes montes_, &c.

Quod ejus commentator +Eustathius+ Thessalonicensis Archiepiscopus
ad Britannos continentem terram incolentes pertinere explicat, ita
verba faciens:[144] “Britannorum autem nomen ferentes sunt e regione
Britannicæ insulæ.” Hic Dionysius a +Plinio+ lib. IV. cap. +XXVII.+
vocatus est terrarum orbis situs recentissimus auctor. unde patet,
quod hi Britanni non diu ante sedem ibi fixerint, atque Gessoriacum
æedificaverint, an vero armorum violentia factum sit, vel absque ferro,
ulteriori disquisitioni reliquendum erit.

_Millium_ L. &c.] Videatur auctor noster cap. VII. p. 96.

_Ut quidam scripsere stadiorum_ CCCCL.] +Antoninus+ in Itinerariis,
& +Dio Cassius+[145]; juxta demensiones recentiores mensurant 39
milliaria Regia seu CCCL. Stadia a Bononia, (_Boulogne_) usque eo, ubi
olim Ritupis sita erat.

_Illinc conspiciuntur Brittones_, &c.] E portu _Ambleteuse_, qui
veterum est Iccius, ora Angliæ opposita, in linea recta tantum 26
milliaria Regia distans, ut ex dimensionibus exactis constat, tota
perfecte conspici potest.

_Virgilius Maro._] Latinos inter Poëtas princeps, in Ecloga prima v. 67.

V. _Agrippa vetus orbis descriptor._] Juliæ Oct. Augusti Cæsaris
filiæ maritus: Primus videtur inter Romanos qui corpus Geographiæ
conscripsit. Fundavit is Romæ PANTHEON, veram omnis bonæ architecturæ
epitomen: De eo ejusque Commentariis +Plinius+ hoc perhibet
testimonium[146]: ‘+Agrippam+ quidem in tanti viri diligentia,
præterque in hoc opere cura, orbem cum terrarum orbi spectandum,
propositurus esset, errasse quis credat, & cum eo Divum +Augustum+? Is
namque complexam eam porticum ex destinatione & commentariis M. Agrippa
a sorore ejus inchoatam peregit.’ Nummi ejus in curiosorum reperiuntur
Musæis, in quibus corona navali coronatus cernitur[147], juxta illud
+Dionis+ lib. XLIX. p. 400.

_Latitudinem ejus_ CCC.] Latitudo hæc ab +Agrippa+ assignata e
traditionibus Græcis desumta est, satisque bene respondet, si illa
sumitur, quæ inter oram Walliæ & Norfolciæ est, quæ sola latitudo tres
circini mensuras permittit, aliæ omnes latitudines Britanniæ adeo sunt
irregulares, mappam geographicam, perspiciatur. Dio minimum latitudinem
CCC stadiorum esse perhibet[148].

_Beda vero rectius_ CC.] Errat hic +Ricardus+. Verba proprie non
sunt ipsius +Bedæ+, verum e +Gilda+ mutuata[149], qui iterum ea ex
+Æthico+[150], +Orosio+[151], &c. hausit. documentum hoc est inter
plura alia, quæ allegari possent, satis sufficiens, eum numquam vidisse
Gildam. +Dio Cassius+[152] & +Jornandes+ Episcopus latitudinem ad
MMCCCX. Stadia figit[153], quæ æqualia 28875 passibus geometricis
vel CCLXXXIX mill. Rom. +Marcianus+ Heracleota aliam operandi viam
ingressus, latitudinem Britanniæ ita metitur: ‘Latitudo autem ejus
(Albionis) incipit quidem juxta Damnonium, quod dicitur etiam Ocrinum
promontorium; desinit vero ad Novantum Chersonesum, & ejusdem nominis
promontorium; adeo ut latitudo ejus juxta maximam lineam sit stadiorum
MMMLXXXIII. id est CCCLXXXVI. M. P. plus minus[154].

_Quadragies octies Septuaginta quinque M. P._] Verba reperiuntur in
+Beda+[155], +Isidoro+ Hispalensi[156], +Julio Solino+[157], &c.
Commentator hujus vetus ita verba Soliniana explicat[158]: ‘Circuitus
Britanniæ quadragies octies LXXV. sunt. si quis voluerit ipsius
circuitus mensuram scriptam ab Julio facilius intelligere ccc d cccc
es, sive d cccc cccc es fore cognoscat. Sed si alicui tardanti ingenio
hæc dimensio non satisfecerit, miliarios lapides esse fingat, in quibus
XXX[159] lapidum, & d c simpliciter lapides fieri quis dubitabit?’
Sequitur hunc forsitan +Ricardus+ noster Cap. II. 5. cum doctissimo +D.
Smith+[160], qui in iis, quas in Bedæ paginam 40 concinnavit notas,
explicat per tria millia sexingenta milliaria; error hic est in quem
plures alii viri, cetroquin optimi incidere. Duas priores figuras
in ultimas ducere videntur, quod nunquam ab ullo Romanorum auctore
intendi novi cum certissimis. Subintellectum tantum voluere vocabulam
_centena_, & hunc in modum scripsere X̅L̅V̅I̅I̅I̅. LXXV. modus loquendi erat,
quasi nostra lingua diceremus (4875) _Forty eight hundred seventy five
miles_, vel Germanice: =Acht und vierzig hundert, fünf und siebenzig.=
Ast cum maximus commentatorum numerus hoc non attenderit, inde maxima
editionum Plinii pars, immo omnes, confusæ reperiuntur, quippe lineolam
primis litteris superimpositam, quæ centenarium indigitat numerum
millenarium indicare, præcario assumunt. Legitur hinc in Plinio XIII.
M. XVIII. (13018.) loco X̅I̅I̅I̅. XVIII. (1318.) quo ipso, toto cœlo a vero
distant. Methodum meam rectissimam esse apparet, si +Capellam+ cum
+Plinio+ cujus ille fidus est transcriptor, conferimus nulla sane de
certitudine ejusdem mihi superest dubium, quicquid alii in contrarium
scripserunt, cum +Plinium+ ipsum a partibus meis habeam, ita dicentem:
‘Universum Orbis circuitum +Eratosthenes+, ducentorum quinquaginta
duorum millium Stadium prodidit. quæ mensura Romana computatione
efficit trecenties quindecies centena millia passuum[161].’ Et verum id
quidem, nam Stadium CXXV passibus constat[162]. proinde si 252,000 per
125 multiplices, fiunt 31500,000 passuum.

perpetuo margine directi littoris ab tergo abducta, iterum se in
diversos angulos cuneat triquetra, & Siciliæ maxime similis, plana,
ingens, fecunda,’ &c.[168]. Opinio a +Cæsare+ accepta[169], & plurimis,
qui eum sequuntur, auctoribus propagata, verbi causa, a +Diodoro+[170],
+Strabone+[171], &c.

_Unum latus est contra Galliam Celticam_, &c.] Id est, tota Britanniæ
ora Meridionalis ad Canalem Britannicum sita & Galliæ opposita, juxta
verba auctoris, ex +Cæsare+[172] desumta.

_Ad Cantium_, &c.] Infra lib. I. cap. VI. § 5. & 7. describitur; vulgo,
_the North Foreland of Kent_.

_Ad Ocrinum_, &c.] Infra lib. I. cap. VI. § 16. ejus mentionem facit,
hodie _the Lizard Point_, navigantibus notissimum.

_Ad meridiem & Hispaniam Tarracon:_] Revera ita est, vergit enim in
linea recta ad _Cabo de las Pennas_. Illustrat hoc +Agathemerum+,
qui lib. II. cap. IV. de Geographia, ita loquitur: ‘Albion, in qua
castra etiam exstructa, maxima et longissima est. siquidem incipiens
a septentrionibus accedit medium Tarraconensis, ad orientem usque ad
media ferme Germaniæ.’

_Millia Pass._ D.] Secundum dimensiones recenter factas 367 milliaria
Anglicana Regia dimensa[173], quæ CCCC Romana efficiunt, hæc longitudo
est lateris, quam +Ricardus+ noster infra ei tribuit. Attamen illa a
+Cæsare+ tradita longitudo non est nimia, parumque a vero aberrans,
si per ambages oras maritimas mensuraverimus, respectu ejus quam
+Diodorus+ exhibet VII. M. D. Stadiorum[174], aut DCCCC.XXXVII.
milliarium cum dimidio, aut +Strabonis+ VM. Stadiis[175], quæ tamen
DCXXV. milliaria Romana sunt.

II. _Alterum latus_, &c.] Latus Occidentale Britanniæ.

_Vergit ad Hyberniam_, &c.] Cum e diametro oppositum sit oris
occidentalibus Albionis.

_Veterum opinio_, &c.] +Cæsar+ ita habet: ut fert illorum opinio[176],
vel Britannorum, vel potius mercatorum, aut Druidum Gallicorum, certus
sum, eum hoc e Græcis non hausisse scriptoribus.

DCC. _Mill. Pass._] +Diodorus+ Siculus vocat hoc ultimum latus, ejusque
longitudini ascribit XXM stadia[177] vel MMD. M. P. +Ricardus+ infra in
proxima sectione M. milliarium esse dicit, & +Strabo+ unicuique lateri
Britanniæ circiter IVM.CCC vel IVM.CCCC. stadia assignat[178]. Si per
ambages computamus, longissimum omnino latus insulæ est, licet non
excedat 1070 milliaria.

III. _Septemtriones._] Notissima septentrionalis constellatio, ab
astronomis Ursa major dicta, quam, +Homero+ auctore,

    _Ursamque, quam & Plaustrum cognomine vocant,
    Quæ ibidem vertitur & Oriona observat:
    Sola autem expers est undarum Oceani_[179].

_Cui parti nulla est objecta_, &c.] Scilicet toti insulæ acervo hodie
sub nominibus _Orkney_, _Hitland_, & _Ferro_, noto.

_Ad Germaniam magnam_, &c.] Ita a Græcis dictam. comprehendebat hæc
hodiernum Germaniæ Imperium, Belgium, Daniam, Norvegiam, &c.

_Novantum chersoneso._] Descriptam hanc vide Cap. IV. § 40. hodie _the
Mule of Galloway_ in Scotia. locus maximæ versus meridiem vergens,
quem credidere extremam partem septentrionalem hujus Regni falso
veteres[180]. Ita eos emendavimus.

_Per Taixalorum regionis angulum._] Similiter descriptum infra cap. VI.
46. hodie _Buchaness_.

DCCC. _M. P._ &c.] Quod +Diodorus+ alterum a freto ad verticem
assurgens latus, stadium XVM. habere dicit[181]. id est, MDCCCLXXV.
Mill. pass. quod erroneè Monachus noster ad MMCC. evehit, qua nisus
auctoritate, non constat.

_Omnes_, &c.] Certe non alius, præter Cæsarem ejusque sequaces vel
transcriptores. +Cæsar+ vero, quod notatu dignum est, a Druidibus
didicit, etenim vicies centena Mill. pass. ab hoc Imperatore
assignatus circuitus complectitur[182], nullum vero ipso tempore
posteriorum invenimus in hoc ipsi consentientem, licet is proxime ad
veritatem accesserit, immo +Diodorus+ ipsi contemporaneus 5312½ M. P.
statuit[183]. +Strabo+, Augusto imperante florens 1712½ habet[184],
verum, quod dolendum! textus totus est corruptus, & mutilatus in hac
descriptione, quod ex ejusdem libro secundo videri potest, ex quo
etiam textus partim supplendus[185]. +Plinius+ sub Vespasiano, ex
+Isidoro+ Characeno tricies octies viginti quinque[186], aut 3825 M.
P. habet. Sequitur ipsum fideliter +M. Capella+[187]. In +Solino+,
qui Constantini tempore vixit, quadragies octies septuaginta quinque
(ut supra) leguntur[188], quod ex errore +Ricardus+ noster MMMCCCCCC
interpretatur. +Pytheas+ Massiliensis ambitum insulæ majorem esse
XLM. Stadia seu 5000 M. P. secundum Strabonem[189], quod monstrat
Plinium emendandum esse, ubi Pythiæ computum Isidori calculo æqualem
dicit[190], vel potius hunc, ni utrumque omisit.

_Sed errant_, &c.] Atque in id genus rebus vix atque vix ulla est via
evitandi errores. Rationem cur & veteres & recentiores in emetiendo
regionum circuitus dissentientes adeo inveniamus, indicat nobis
+Plinius+ dicens[191].—‘quæ causa magnos errores computatione mensuræ
sæpius parit & dum alibi mutato provinciarum modo, alibi itinerum
auctis aut diminutis passibus, incubuere maria tam longo ævo, alibi
processere littora, torsere se & fluminum aut correxere flexus.
Præterea aliunde aliis exordium mensuræ est, & alia meatus: ita fit, ut
nulli duo concinant.’

CCCC. _M. P._] Distantia hæc, si de ea quæ in linea recta promontoria
duo, quorum facta est mentio, interjacet, exactissima omnium,
quarum mentionem injiciunt veteres, videtur esse; verum si dimensio
intelligitur, quæ ad Canalem sitæ sunt, orarum maritimarum, manifesto
nimis parva est, & correctio locum heic non habet, cum accurata
congruat cum D. M. P. Cæsaris. Doct. +N. Grew+ asserit, inde a
promontorio meridionali Cantii, _the South Foreland_, ad promontorium
Antivestæum, _the Land’s End_, esse 367 perambulatore mensurata
(_wheel-measured_) milliaria[192], quæ plus minus æqualia sunt CCCCI.
Mill. Pass.

_M. Mill. Pass._ &c.] Unde +Ricardus+ noster, has correctiones
hauserit, nisi ex scholiis quibusdam +Cæsaris+, +Solini+, +Bedæ+, &c.
conjecturatu perquam difficile, præcipue cum ipsum Cap. I. § 5. cum
+Marciano+ Heracleota consentientem, jam vero dissentientem videamus,
etenim auctor, ut supra[193] diximus, distantiam, quæ in linea recta
est Ocrinum inter & Novantum 386 M. P. ponit id quod Monachus noster
ad 1000 evehit, qui numerus fere triplo major est. Quod ad totum, quem
statuit, circuitum numeris rotundis MMMCCCCCC complexum attinet, cum
tantum ad XXV. M. P. excedat priorem 3575 milliarium nullam meretur
ista differentia attentionem, me judice Benedictinus noster fidelis
videtur compilator, & bono animo præditus, verum talis, qui nunquam
ultimam limam admovit commentariolo suo, licet memoriæ minus fideli
laborasse nec accuratum satis fuisse non credam, defectus vero istius
rationem disceptationem eum inter & Antistitem suum, de qua terminis
satis patheticis loquitur pagina 95, 103, & 106, fuisse credo. Inde
constat, cur Silures Hispaniam versus habitare doceat, in quo +Tacito+
sequitur[194], verum persuasus sum, si opus suum attente reviserit,
+Mappam+ ejus ipsi errorem omnem eripuisse. verum autem vero, quid
dicatur in excusationem celebris cujusdam auctoris ex recentioribus,
qui Herculis promontorium in parte Devoniæ versus Caurum (_the North
West_) collocat, narratque illud a situ in hac insulæ parte, quæ
Herculis columnas seu Gades respicit (eodem jure Caput bonæ spei
dixisset) nomen cepisse[195]. Attamen si de Ocrino dixisset illud, ejus
in gratiam, licet impropriissime dictum, admittere tamen potuissemus.

IV. _Formam totius Brittaniæ_, &c.] Formæ regionibus tributæ mere sunt
imaginariæ, e fructifera spectatorum imaginatione resultantes, cum
ipsæ propter inæqualitates partium perfectæ figuræ sint incapaces.
Sic ubi videmus +Strabonem+ Orbem universum chlamydi assimilare[196],
+Dionysium+ eum fundæ similem fingere[197], +Strabonem+ Hispaniæ pellis
bovinæ speciem ascribere[198], +Polybium+ Italiæ formam trigoni,
+Plinium+ & +Solinum+ querno folio similem referre[199], +Livium+
Britanniæ nostræ scutulæ figuram[200], +Fabium+ bipennis[201],
& +Alsherif Aledresy+ (aut Geographum Nubiensem) Strutiocameli
similitudinem tribuere[202], condonare illis, æquique & boni illud
consulere decet, nec iis solum verum & recentioribus qui Angliam, armum
ovillum (_a shoulder of mutton_) Galliam, uropygium bovis (_a rump of
beef_) Hiberniam, peltam Amazonicam; Islandiam, assellum (_a stock
fish_) insigne hujus insulæ; Cimbricam chersonesum, linguam caninam;
Belgium, leonem exsilientem; Italiam, ocream; totam Europam, virginem;
Americam, clepsydram, &c. representare dicunt.

_Sed Cæsare_, &c.] Ita etiam +Diodorus+ Siculus[203], +Strabo+
Cappadox[204], +Pomponius Mela+[205], &c. eam triquetræ vel triquadræ
dixere similem; quod licet non omnino stricte satis congruat,
attamen optime hac figura geometrica complexam dixeris. Linea a
Cantio ad Antivestæum ducta est basis 367 milliarium, duplum hujus
longitudinis detur utrique cruri in _Ferro Head_ promontorio, sive
_Cape Wreath_ terminato, △ isosceles 1835 milliarium mensuratorum in
circuitu complectens habes, monstrans geometricum circuitum Magnæ
Britanniæ, tantum ad unum milliare a celeberrimi +Cambdeni+ computo
aliis operationibus nixo[206], differentem, quod ipsum notatu est
dignissimum. Palam est figuram hanc totam superficiem insulæ continere
134689 milliaribus quadratis, cum, quæ in mari exstant, partes cum iis
quæ mari ingressum permittunt, accuratissime mire congruant. Additur
jam superficies unius cruris, propter crenatas orarum incisiones,
quod, experientia teste, nimium non est, integer circuitus Albionis
geographicus prodibit æqualis 2569 milliaribus Regiis: sive vicies
octies centenis novem millibus passuum, id est 2809 milliaribus
Romanis, quod mihi cogitandi ansam præbet, +Plinii+ tricies octies
vigintiquinque M. P. corrigenda esse[207], ut sint vicies octies
vigintiquinque, tuncque remanet tantum differentia XVI. M. P. quam pro
nihilo omnino reputare licet.

V. _Si Ptolemæo_, &c.] +Claudius Ptolemæus+ Astronomus & Geographus
celeberrimus, (Patriæ Pelusiota), qui & Alexandrini nomen fert, non
quod Alexandriæ natus sit, sed quia observationes suas ibi instituit.
+Ricardus+ noster simul cum aliis Monachis eum Regem Ægypti facit[208].
scripsit ille IIX libros Geographiæ, quibus aliorum sui temporis
errores correxit. Liber II. III. IV. V. & VI. si non integrum opus,
videntur non esse nisi corrupta & jejuna epitome, rationes, quæ huc
faciunt, non sunt hujus loci, innituntur vero, iis, quæ occurrunt in
+Marciano Jornande+[209], +Ravennate+, &c.

_Litteram Z sed inversam_, &c.] Hoc ipsissimum illud videtur, quod
+Tacitus+ supra, per immensum & enorme spatium indigitat, +Cæsar+que
innuit, dicens, lateris orientis angulum maxime ad Germaniam
spectare[210], quæ opinio in tantum invaluit, ut etiam ad seculum
XLV tum firma manserit. Apparet hoc ex illo +Gemmæ Frysii+, de Orbis
divisione cap. IV. ‘Contendunt, inquit, hic multi, præcipue nostri
sæculi, Geographi, superiorem angulum Scotiæ non eo modo in ortum
prominere quemadmodum Ptolemæus ac nostri Globi descriptio habet. Verum
his (quam nihil habeant, quo id edocere possint) temere fides adhibenda
non est, imo ipsimet Scoti, nobis inquirentibus, in orientem solem
latus extare, fessi sunt.’ Hi e Scylla Charybdin incidentes, polos
mutatos esse supponunt[211], unde iis ceu melius fundamentum cum super
ædificent suam Theoriam, notam meam pag. 154. N. 67. commendatam volo.

_Mapparum inspectio._] Propriam verosimiliter putat auctor, sed aliter
sentiunt nostri ævi eruditi[212].

Ut caput hoc completum reddamus in describendis oris Albionis
subsistimus, ut jam a +Ptolemæo+ descriptæ sunt[213], ad minimum
in iis, quæ nomen ejus habent, libris, partes interiores, notasque
reservaturi donec ad loca, quorsum pertinent, pervenerimus.

                             THE WEDDINGS.


There is an old proverb common in Somersetshire, “Stanton Drew, _a
mile from_ Pensford, _another from_ Chue;” which should denote some
peculiar regard and excellence in that town, and direction for the
ready finding it: and in fact it highly deserves to be celebrated, upon
account of that remarkable monument, vulgarly called the Weddings,
whose name only is but just known to the curious and learned world. To
redeem it from further obscurity, I took a journey thither from the
Bath in July 1723, where calling on my friend Mr. Strachey, a worthy
fellow of the Royal Society, and who has shewn his knowledge in his
nice remarks upon the neighbouring coal-mines, we made mensurations of
this notable work together. I find it is the most considerable remnant
of the ancient Celts which I yet know, next to Stonehenge and Abury.
Mr. Aubrey, that indefatigable searcher-out of antiquities, is the
first that has observed it; and I believe Mr. Strachey, living near the
place, is the first that measured it, since the original ground-line
was stretched upon the spot. To open a more exact view of this noble
antiquity, observe we that there is a little stream runs into the
Avon between Bath and Bristol, called Chue, arising near here at a
synonymous town, and first passes under a stone bridge at Stanton Drue,
where making a pretty turn, as it were, half inclosing our monument, a
little further it comes to Pensford; which is an old British name, for
it is written Pennis-ford, _Pen isc_ signifying the head of the river.
It was a common usage among all ancient nations, so with our ancestors,
to pay a sacred reverence to the fountains of rivers, and frequently
were they sought for upon religious occasions, judging a divinity must
needs reside where so beneficial an element takes its rise. The road
from Pensford to Chue goes along the north side of the river; and
there, half a mile above, and half a mile below the bridge, lie two
great stones, called Hautvil’s Coyts, according to the apprehension of
the common people, said to be pitched there by Sir John Hautvil, of
these parts, a famous champion, of whom legends are printed under the
name of Sir John Hawkwell, as vulgarly pronounced. These stones now lie
flat upon the ground by the road side, but said to have been standing,
and much larger than they are at present; for some pieces have been
knocked off. We measured that toward Pensford 13 foot long, 8 broad,
and 4 thick, being a hard reddish stone. Stanton Drue church bears
here south-west. What regard this has to the temple which it overlooks
on the other side the river, and from higher ground, I cannot say;
whether it is the remnant (together with the former) of some avenue,
or whether it was carried thither, or laid for some direction to those
that lived on that side the river. Repassing the bridge, and entering
the inclosures east of the church which belong to a farm there, we come
to the Weddings. Here is an old manor-house adjacent, which has been a
castle; for the walls are crenated, and some half-moons built to it.
The farm-house is an old stone building, said to have been a nunnery,
probably founded by some pious lady of the manor. There is a great
hall in it, open to the cieling, handsomely made of timber work, and
two arched windows with mullions on each side; and all the windows of
the house are arched in the same manner: at the east end is a winding
stone stair-case, and near it, in the yard, an elegant stone dove-cote,
round, with six buttresses. This house, with the church and that part
of the grounds which is the site of our monument, is a knoll of rising
ground, of an oval form, stretched out with a whole broad side against
the river, half embracing it with a circular sweep, and but little
space between it and the river; and that side from the river has a
delicate acclivity or valley winding round it, answerable to the river.
The longer _axis_ of this knoll is from north-east to south-west:
the major part of it declines manifestly gently toward the river, or
northward, and is finely guarded from the north winds by a ridge of
hills adjacent; upon the summit of which is an ancient fortification,
called Miz knoll, in the road to Bristol: this is a pleasant place,
full of hedges and trees growing very tall, especially elms. The
country is stoney, covered over with a reasonable _stratum_ of sandy
ground, mixed with clay, which is rich enough. One would imagine this
knoll was pitched upon by the founders for the sake of its figure,
and because capable of giving a sufficient liability to their work:
its declivity carries off the rain, always regarded in this manner of
building; for that would loosen the foundations. Here is a fine large
_area_ between the temples, for the rites of sacrifice, &c.

I wondered that I observed no _tumuli_, or barrows, the burying-places
of the people about it, as in other cases, but suppose it owing to the
goodness of the soil; for they wisely pitched upon barren ground to
repose their ashes, where they could only hope to lie undisturbed: and
on Mendip hills, not far off, they are very numerous. This particularly
I am told of seven that are remarkable. This monument about ten years
ago must have made a most noble appearance, because then perfect. It
seems the nuns, and all the possessors of the estate, had left it
untouched till a late tenant, for covetousness of the little space of
ground they stood upon, buried them for the most part in the ground:
he was justly punished, for the grass at this time will not grow over
them, but withers, because there is not a sufficient depth of earth:
however, for the pleasure of the curious, it is not difficult to
retrieve its original figure from what remains. It is the general case
of fine monuments, in their perfect state disregarded and obscure, but
their ruins are caressed and adored: and this was really an elegant
monument, and highly worth visiting, and claims an eminent place in the
history of Celtic temples.

The monument consists of four distinct parts, three distant circles,
and a cove. The stone it is composed of, is of such a kind as I have
not elsewhere seen; certainly intirely different from that of the
country, which is a slab kind. If any stone ever was, this would tempt
one to think it factitious, though I think nothing less: it looks like
a paste of flints, shells, crystals, and the like solid corpuscles
crowded together and cemented, but infallibly by Nature’s artifice.
The long current of years passing over it, and its most perishable
parts being wasted away, leaves the rest much corroded externally,
and as it were worm-eaten by dint of time: yet of itself it will
stand for ever; for its texture is extremely hard, and beyond that of
marble, at least those of Marlborough downs. If I have any judgement,
by oft surveying these kind of works, and with a nice eye, I guess by
its present appearance, and consideration of its wear, to be older
than Abury and Stonehenge. One would think, from its dusky and rusty
colour, that it is a kind of iron stone: it is very full of fluors and
transparent crystallisations, like Bristol stones, large, and in great
lumps; so that it shines eminently, and reflects the sun-beams with
great lustre. I cannot but think that it is brought from St. Vincent’s
rock, near the mouth of Bristol river, as Mr. Aubrey says expresly;
though Mr. Strachey, who has curiously observed every thing of this
kind, cannot affirm it: and if its comes no further, we may well admire
at the strength and manner requisite to convey them hither over that
rocky country, wholly consisting of hills, and dales, and woods: but
the notion of religion fully answers all difficulties; and the founders
well provided for the perpetuity of their work, in the election of
their materials. I found some stone like this by the sea side, this
Summer, at Southampton; and the walls of the town are mostly built of
it. The stones in our work are apparently very shapely, and squared,
though with no mathematical exactness, that is, not hewn with a tool,
but rather, as we may suppose, broke by flints, and a great strength
of hand, in those early ages, when iron tools were not found out:
the greatest number of the stones are now visible, either standing,
fallen, or buried in the ground by the person before mentioned; the
places of such for the most part are apparent enough, the grass growing
but poorly above, as we said before, so that the purpose of interring
them is defeated, and more grass lost by their lying than when they
stood in their places. Many may be found by knocking with one’s heel
upon the spot, whence there is a sound; others, by thrusting an iron
rod into the earth. The species of the stone renders it useless to be
wrought up in building, especially in this country, that abounds with
more manageable stone for the purpose. From the regular figures of the
stones, as well as their order of positure, the eyes of a spectator
would have been charmed with the sight of this work when in perfection,
and the whole plain open to the view: at present they are separated by
hedge-rows, yards, orchards, and the like; and the persons that laid
them out have aukwardly cut them off by the middle, or by segments: the
great single circle now stands in no less than three fields, and the
other great concentric circles have a ditch and quickset hedge running
across one side: the lesser circle is divided in the middle, one half
remaining in a pasture, the other among the apple-trees in an orchard.
The cove stands in the middle of another orchard by the church and
farm-house, which we said was a nunnery, as tradition goes.

The idea upon which some of these stones are formed, is different from
any I have observed elsewhere. Abury and Stonehenge, and all others yet
come to my knowledge, are broad stones: these are square, or what we
may call pilasters; I mean those of the innermost circle, or cell, of
what I name the Planetary temple: the rest are all of equal dimensions,
being six foot broad, nine high, and three thick; so that their base is
a double cube, their length a cube and a half, which shows sufficiently
that the builders of this work, as in all others of the like, studied
proportion, whence beauty flows. The stones of the outer circle at
Stonehenge are of the same model as to the base, but higher upon the
breadth, being likewise a double cube. I understand all the while in
our monument, that these are Celtic feet, for such I found them, and by
that scale is the construction of the whole: also what I speak of is
their measure above ground; for I did not desire to indulge a dangerous
curiosity in searching how deep they are set in the ground, which has
been too fatal already in these antiquities.

[Sidenote: TAB. LXXVIII.]

The four parts which make up this monument, as we said, are the cove,
two single circles, and a quincuple circle. The cove, as most commonly,
consists of three stones, set in a half-moon figure, or, to be more
exact, upon the end of an _ellipsis_, whose _focus_, I suppose, would
be in a line upon the foremost edges of the two wings. This is situate
in the south-west part of the oval knoll of ground that contains the
whole; at present in an orchard south of the church, and west of the
nunnery before mentioned. The wings are standing, but much diminished
by age or violence; some great pieces being broke off: the stone on
the back is fallen down, being a larger one: it is 13 foot long, and
8 broad; therefore of the same dimensions with Hautvil’s Coyt, before
spoken of. This cove opens to the south-east. Four hundred foot from
this, going eastward, and with an angle of 20 degrees southward, in
another orchard east of the dove-cote, is a lesser single circle,
which is 120 foot diameter: this stands upon the southern side of the
knoll, and consists of 12 stones, consequently set at the interval
of 30 foot, the same as those of the circles at Abury. Here are all
the stones left upon the spot, but prostrate, half being within the
hedge, half without. This I call the Lunar Temple. This circle is the
same diameter and number of stones with the inner circles of the two
temples in the work at Abury. Five hundred foot distant from this,
going north-easterly, viz. with an angle of 20 degrees northerly from
the east, and across the orchard, and a pasture, is the circumference
of the greater single circle: the centre of it is in the next pasture
to the north-east: it is 300 foot in diameter, and composed of 30
stones, set at the distance of 30 foot, as before: about 20 of the
stones are remaining, but of that number only three standing. The whole
circle is contained in three pastures: the plain on which it stands
descends gently toward the river, and keeps it constantly dry. But 30
foot from this circle is the circumference of the outer circle of the
quincuple one, or five concentric circles, the centre whereof is in
an angle of 20 degrees more southerly from the line that connects the
centres of the two single circles; so that it bears a little northerly
of the east from the solar circle. The manner of thus conjoining five
circles in one is very extraordinary, and what I have no where else met
withal; and its primitive aspect must have had as remarkable an effect,
by the crebrity of the stones, as their intervals: and, upon moving
towards them, or sideways, they must have created the same beautiful
and surprising appearance to the eye, as the more learned architects
have endeavoured by the multiplicity of columns in their portico’s,
_forums_, and the like, of which Vitruvius speaks: yet I think, in
my judgement, this circular work must needs vastly have exceeded, in
this particular, those most celebrated works of the Greeks and Romans;
because in a strait walk there is but always the same variety (if we
may talk so) presented to the eye; whereas in ours, the circles not
being exactly at the same distance from one another as the stones are,
and therefore not confining themselves to so strict a regularity,
it must have heightened that agreeable diversification. It is very
obvious, that the compilers used art and consideration in adjusting the
diameters with the number of the stones, and that one circle should
not be vastly disproportionate to another: thus the outermost circle
is 310 foot in diameter; therefore it receives 32 stones at 30 foot
interval: the next is 250 in diameter, with 28 stones: the
next, 230; consequently requires 22 stones to complete it: the next is
150 foot in diameter, consisting of 16 stones: the innermost is 90,
therefore has 9 stones; but then two of them are crowded together, and
set at an angle a little obtuse, so that they form a sort of niche, or
cove, of a different manner from any other. Several of these stones
are fallen, several stand; which may be better understood by surveying
the drawings, than by a tedious recapitulation: therefore I took
different views of the work hereabouts, where it is most intire, that
in after-times, by comparing the prints with the life, the difference
may appear, if any shall be; but I hope they ever will be useless to
those that view the place itself, and that the owners of the estate
will preserve the monument for the glory of their country.

In reflecting upon these matters as I travelled along, it seemed to
me not much to be doubted, that, as Stonehenge is an improvement upon
Abury, so Abury is executed upon a grander plan, taken from this, or
some such like. I can scarce think there ever was an avenue to this
work, nor any ditch about it. It is true, there is a ditch, or mote,
now round the north side along the river: but I believe it was only
a fish-pond, or canal, made for the use of the manor-house, or the
nunnery, in whose demesnes soever it were; and it is plain there is
no sign of a ditch on the south side, where most occasion, because
the river on the other side produces the use and effect of it: and if
those stones called Hautvile’s Coyts were not set there for direction
of the old Britons which way to come in this woody country, or where
a ford of the river was, why might they not be stones dropped by the
way in journeying to the temple? and they are of the same dimensions
with that on the back of the cove. I am very apt to think there was
another work, a cove at least, in a triangle with the other and the
lunar circle; and the rather, because the manor-house and offices being
built upon its situation, it were easy for them to throw it down under
some foundation: and then the _area_, or whole content of the oval
knoll, would be filled up handsomely, and with great regularity. And
indeed I am shocked at the number of the works at present, being four;
whereas that of five seems much more eligible in this case, both as
an odd number, and an harmonic: for I doubt not but the Druids, the
contrivers of these structures, had a good notion of music, as I could
evidence in some observations I have made in the very matters before
us; but I fear to be thought whimsical in a thing of this nature, and
in a subject so wholly new. It is certain Pythagoras, the Arch-druid,
as I venture to call him, completed this art. Now, what can be plainer
than the conformity between this work and Abury? the same situation,
near the spring of a river, upon a knoll in a large valley, guarded
from severity of weather by environing hills: here is the cove of
three stones; the circle of twelve; that of thirty stones, all set at
the same intervals of thirty foot: here are the concentric circles.
But then Abury is a vastly more extensive and magnificent design; the
stones of much larger dimensions, and much more numerous. Here are
two circles, the one of twelve, the other of thirty stones; but at
Abury they have repeated them, and doubled them, by setting one within
the other: the quincuple circle they have infinitely exceeded by the
prodigious circular portico of a hundred stones on a side; then by the
mighty ditch and _vallum_ encompassing it; by two avenues three miles
in length, each of a hundred stones on a side: by the temple on Overton
hill, by Silbury hill, and other matters, they have so far exceeded
their copy, that in the total they have outdone themselves, and
created a Celtic wonder of the world, or the eighth. But to return to
our present subject.

The stones of our innermost circle of the quincuple one are twelve foot
high above ground, and are of a square form, being four foot broad on
each side, whence they compose three solids, one set upon another, and
therefore appeared higher above the tops of the rest. Five of them are
standing, and the roots of them two which are placed close together
with their edges, and which make the cove; for the stones themselves
are split from their foundation by some unaccountable violence, which,
upon consideration, I can attribute to nothing less than a stroke of
lightning; nor can I conceive that any other impulse, except that of a
cannon bullet, could have so disjointed or fractured them. This set of
circles are placed on the eastern side of the knoll, and have a fine
declivity two or three ways for carrying off the rain. This niche,
or cove, if such it be, opens to the north, and a little westerly:
several of the stones of the outer circles stand on the other side
of the hedge, and two or three are sunk into the ditch: those are
vulgarly called the Fidlers, as the others the Maids, or the revel
rout attendant on a marriage festival; for the people of this country
have a notion, that upon a time a couple were married on a Sunday, and
the friends and guests were so prophane as to dance upon the green
together, and by a divine judgment were thus converted into stones: so
I suppose the two stones so close together in the inner circle were
reputed the Bride and Bridegroom: the rest were the Company dancing,
and the Fidlers stood on the outside. I have observed that this notion
and appellation of Weddings, Brides, and the like, is not peculiar to
this place, but applied to many other of these Celtic monuments about
the kingdom; as the Nine Maids in Cornwall, nine great stones set all
in a row: whence possibly one may conjecture, in very ancient times it
was a custom here, even of the Christians, to solemnise marriage and
other holy rites in these ancient temples, perhaps before churches were
built in little parishes: and even now they retain, or very lately did,
in Scotland, a custom of burying people in the like temples, as judging
them holy ground; without all doubt, continued down from the Druidical
times. Or there may be another conceit offered, of which the reader may
chuse which pleases him best; that is, that such names of these places
may be derived from the mad, frolicksome, and Bacchanalian ceremonies
of the ancient Britons in their religious festivals, like those of all
other nations which are recorded to us in history. However, I think it
is a confirmation of what wants none, that these are the temples of
the Gods, made by our British predecessors; of which we come next to
deliver our opinion.

We are to consider, upon the plan proposed, what regard is had to the
Celtic Deities, which we said were seven in number; and methinks it is
easy to point out at this day the particular Gods worshipped in these
places, as I have named them upon the Plate. The Sun and Moon, no
doubt, claim the highest place in the opinion of all nations; therefore
their temples are situate in the midst of the plain of the oval knoll:
these are the two single circles: the Sun’s is easily distinguishable
from the other by its bulk, and being toward the right hand, and
toward the east, the more worthy part: this consisting of 30 stones,
and the other of 12, seem to mean the Solar month, and Lunar year: the
quincuple circle I suppose consecrate to the five lesser planets; and
that the cove appertained to the Service of the Goddess of the Earth,
therefore opens to the South, respecting full the meridian power of
the Soul of the World, without whose beams it is dead and inert. Hence
therefore the reason of their order in Situation: the Lunar temple is
next the earth, because so in the heavens; the Sun next above; and the
planets highest, according to the order one would be apt to suppose
they observed in Nature. It seems likely that the Celtic philosophers
reckoned the north the highest part or end of the world, either from
the elevation of the north pole to us of northern latitude, as our
geographers now practise in maps and charts, by making the north part
uppermost; or because they came from that quarter of the world in the
progress of nations: but we must join the east with it; for _that_,
ever since the Creation, in all systems of religion, and nations, has
been especially reverenced, because of the Sun’s rising: and the west
was reckoned the lower part of the world, the hell and region of the
dead, the Elysian Shades, and the like; because the Sun sets there, and
seems to go down: therefore we may observe the reason of the cove being
placed most westerly, because the earth possesses the lowest place,
the rest mounting north-easterly. The niche or cove of the innermost
planet regards the north, or a little westerly, as denoting, beyond the
stars was stretched out the great _inane_ of Nature, or infinite space,
the empty north, as most distant and dissonant from the south, where
was the Sun and world, the foundation of being. If one would enter
into their theology, one might conjecture that they meant likewise the
creation of the world; for the north, or immense void, being uppermost
in their esteem, showed that the world was produced from nothing, by
the Supreme Power. To this purpose holding night prior to day, they
reckoned their time by winters, nights, etc. One other remark I made on
the genius and geometry of the founders of the Weddings; that in the
inner circle of the Planetary temple, which is but 90 foot diameter,
and therefore an eye in the centre is very near them, there is a
considerable artifice used in its component stones; for, though they
be square, yet they are so managed that the face on the outside of
the periphery is somewhat broader than the other three; hereby it is
caused, that the two sides upon the _radius_ respect the centre of the
circle. This is contrived to prevent the great offence to the eye which
would otherwise have been caused in this lesser circle, had the stones
been perfectly square, and, instead thereof, give a particular delight.

I mentioned before, how much I suspected a cove which had stood near
the manor-house in the north-west part of the knoll: this I would
have dedicated to the element of Water, or particularly to the river
flowing by, the _Isca_, which I have shewn to be its Celtic name: and
this cove, thus situate, would offer itself conveniently to the course
of the stream, and meet, as it were, to salute the Nymphs or Naids
moving down the Stream eastward. I think likewise this might be another
reason of their pitching upon this piece of ground; for probably they
might think there was more sanctity in a river that ran eastward: it
is certain the ancients accounted it more wholesome, for a physical
reason, as meeting the Sun’s rising beams, to purify it from all
noxious vapor: and for this same reason is there another similitude
between this work and that of Abury, the Kennet running eastward its
whole length.

As soon as I came on the ground, I observed the form of the hill
or knoll that contains this work, and that it perfectly resembles
that of the ancient circus’s; and the fine lawn on the south side,
together with the interval northwards between it and the river, made
an admirable _cursus_ for races of horses, chariots, and the like,
as I doubt not in the least to have been the practice in old British
times at this very place. This notion is exceedingly confirmed by the
remarkable turn in the road, humouring exactly the circuit of this
_cursus_, and coinciding with part of it, as is apparent in the view
of the country Plate; and just on the south side the manor-house is a
declivity at this day, and so quite round, admirably adapted to the
benefit of the spectators, who, running round in a lesser circle,
might easily equal the swiftness of the horse, and be spectators of
the whole course. I suppose all the sorts of games practised here,
which are mentioned in Homer upon the death of Patroclus: this was done
at their great religious festivals, and at the exequies of renowned
commanders, kings, and chiefs; for it is remarkable at this very day,
all those sports mentioned by the most ancient poet are now practised
among us; which shews our Asian extract from the early times, and only
accounts for that surprising custom of chariots mentioned to be among
the Britons by Cæsar, which they wisely applied to war likewise, whilst
the Romans used them only upon their _circus_ and diversions. The great
plain in the middle of the _area_ was convenient for the works of
sacrificing, and after for feastings, wrestling, coyting, and the like:
and from the memory, perhaps, of these kind of exercises, sprung the
notion of Sir John Hautvil’s Coyts, he being a strong and valiant man,
and expert in these games of our hardy ancestors: the vulgar confounded
the two histories into one, and, fond of the marvellous, applied the
name of Coyts to those monstrous stones. So in Wales to this day they
call the _Kromlechea_, Arthur’s Coyts.

Thus therefore we may in imagination view a solemn sacrifice of
magnanimous Britons, the Druids and other priests, the kings and people
assembled: we may follow them imitating the course of the Sun, and,
like the ancient Greeks at their solemn games, celebrating splendidly,
in honour of their Gods, upon the winding banks of the rivers. The
temple at Diospolis in Egypt, described by Strabo, XVII. is not unlike
our Celtic ones, having a _dromos_, or circ, before it, with stones cut
like _sphynges_ to mark out the _route_, and a _portico_ quite round.
The walls, says he, are as high as the temple, which is without roof,
and covered over with sculpture of large figures. There is one part
composed of abundance of huge pillars set in very many rows, having
nothing painted or elegant, but seems like an empty labour, as he
expresses it; and this was, because the Grecian temples of his country
were covered over, and the walls adorned with painting and carving,
and all sorts of curiosities in art. In this temple (he proceeds)
were formerly great houses for the priests, men given to philosophy
and astronomy: but now that order and discipline is failed, and only
some sorry fellows left, that take care of the sacrifices, and show
the things to strangers. Eudoxus and Plato went hither, and lived
thirteen years to learn of them. These priests knew the minute excess
of the year above 365 days, and many more like things; for, says he,
the Greeks were ignorant of the year at that time. Thus far Strabo. It
is notorious from the foregoing particulars, how near a resemblance
these had to our Celtic temples, and likewise to the famous ruins
at Persepolis, which I always looked upon as a great temple of the
Persians. Those that think it the ruins of a royal palace, run away
content with the report of the ignorant people living thereabouts.
This temple of the Egyptians, which Strabo describes, had no
roof; and therefore it would be absurd to place paintings in it, and
fine carvings of ivory, gold and marble, from the hand of Phidias,
or Praxiteles, as was the usage of the Greeks; whence Strabo takes
occasion to throw a sarcasm upon people that he would not have thought
so elegant as his countrymen. It is certain the Egyptians, as well as
our Celts, studied greatness and astonishment, beyond the nice and
curious; as is visible in all their works, such as the pyramids, the
obelisks, Pompey’s pillar, the monstrous _colossi_ and _sphynges_, of
which we have many accounts in writers, and many of their prodigious
works still left, which defy time by their magnitude, like our Celtic:
but the Greeks ought to be so grateful as to acknowledge by whom they
profited; for they learnt first from the Egyptians; nor will we deny
that they improved upon them. When Strabo mentions these roofless
temples, and walls covered with sculptures of large figures, and the
abundance of huge pillars set in many rows, who sees not the exact
conformity between this work, and that of Persepolis? and these
collections of pillars, though I suppose set in a square form, are no
other than our quincuple circle. I took notice too, that these temples
are set in such straggling order as ours here at Stanton Drue, and by
examination find that the two largest are at an angle of 20 degrees of
one another (I mean, their middle points, or centres) from the cardinal
line, or that which runs from east to west: here is likewise the same
number of five temples, and like diversity of number of stones, and
manner of forms in each, as of ours: the only difference consists
in the one being square, the other round; owing to the particular
notions of the two people, judging this, and that, most apt for sacred
structures. The work at Persepolis too is made upon an artificial
eminence, or pavement of most prodigious stones, instead of a natural
one, the ascent to which is by steps; which is enough to overthrow
any notion of a palace: but they that see not its intent, that it was
wholly a religious building, and that there is not one symptom of its
being a civil one, ought to be disregarded. All the sculptures are
religious, being processions of the priests to sacrifice; which has
nothing to do with a palace: the work of pillars never had a roof on
it, because of the flower-work at top: besides, there are no walls,
never were; and what the incurious spectators take for walls, are only
single stones set like those of our monument: and the doors are no
more than one stone laid across two more, as those of Stonehenge: the
mouldings of them go quite round; so that, had there been a wall, half
of them would have been covered. But it is lost time to speak any more
of that affair.

  _Stukeley d._

  _A View at_ Stanton Drew]

I make no doubt but the name of Stanton Drue is derived from our
Monument; _Stanton_ from the stones, and _Drue_ from the Druids. It
moves not me, that some of the name of Drew might have lived here
formerly; for such a family might take the denomination of the town,
and, leaving out the first part, retain only that of Drew. It is
sufficient conviction, that there are so many other towns in England,
and elsewhere, that have preserved this name, and all remarkable for
monuments of nature. The number of the stones are 160.

[1] _Covinus Cimbricus, sicut hodie utuntur._

[2] In one of the carved monuments Venus stands in an apartment of
  a building, seeming to be combing her hair; perhaps from a bath.
  However, at Rome was a statue of Venus holding a comb, not an
  improper utensil for the goddess of beauty, not a little of which
  consists in the hair. Thus says Claudian,

  _Thessalico roseos nectebat pectine crines._

  So Juno, when dressing herself to recover the love of her husband,
  is represented by the father of the poets combing her hair: Il. ξ.
  _depexos nitide nodo substricta capillos_. But the reason of the
  statue before mentioned was thus: there was a cutaneous distemper
  among the Roman women, injurious to their hair; for they were
  forced to cut it all off: therefore they dedicated a statue to
  _Venus Pectinigera_, upon which their hair came again as fine as
  ever. This story is told in Suidas.
